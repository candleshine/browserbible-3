<div class="c">4</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_1" data-id="EP4_1">Therefore, from this prison where I am because I proclaim the Lord Jesus, I urge you whom God has chosen to live in a way that honors Jesus, who called you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_2" data-id="EP4_2">Humbly and gently and patiently serve the needs of one another because you love each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_3" data-id="EP4_3">Do all you can to remain united with one another by peacefully living together with each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_4" data-id="EP4_4">All believers form one group, and there is only one Holy Spirit, and you were chosen to confidently wait for God to fulfill His promises to you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_5" data-id="EP4_5">There is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, in whom we all trust together. And there is only one way to baptize anyone into his name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_6" data-id="EP4_6">There is one God, the true Father of everyone. He rules over all his people and fills everything with his power.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_7" data-id="EP4_7">God has generously given to each believer spiritual gifts that Christ has measured out to us as he wishes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_8" data-id="EP4_8">This is similar to what the Psalmist said about God receiving tribute money from those whom he had conquered,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP4_8" data-id="EP4_8">When he ascended to his city at the top of the mountain,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP4_8" data-id="EP4_8">he led the captives into captivity</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EP4_8" data-id="EP4_8">and gave their gifts of tribute to his people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_9" data-id="EP4_9">The words "he ascended" certainly make us know that Christ had also previously descended to the earth from heaven, like God's anointed king coming down from Jerusalem to fight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_10" data-id="EP4_10">Christ, who descended to earth to conquer evil, is also the one who was crucified for our sins, came back to life, and ascended to the most exalted position in heaven, in order that he might fill all things with his power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_11" data-id="EP4_11">He appointed some believers to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some to lead and others to teach the groups of believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_12" data-id="EP4_12">This was to prepare God's people to do God's work and serve others, so that all the people who belong to Christ might become spiritually strong</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_13" data-id="EP4_13">He wants all of us believers to be united together as we all trust in him and grow to fully understand him. He wants us to become mature believers, together, growing to become like himself, who is perfect. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_14" data-id="EP4_14">Then we will no longer be ignorant of what is true, like little children. We will no longer follow every new teaching, like a boat is blown around by the wind and waves. We will not allow people who teach what is false to trick us and deceive us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_15" data-id="EP4_15">Instead, we will live by loving God and trusting his true teachings, and we will become more and more like Christ in every way. He controls his people like a person's head controls his body.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_16" data-id="EP4_16">He enables all believers everywhere to grow together and love each other, like a person's body fits together and holds together by the joints that connect the body together, which allows the body to grow and build itself up because the parts of body depend upon each other.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_17" data-id="EP4_17">By the authority of the Lord Jesus, I strongly affirm that you must no longer live like the unbelieving non-Jews do. The futile way they think directs them how to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_18" data-id="EP4_18">They are unable to think clearly about what is right or wrong. They cannot comprehend obeying God because they refuse to listen to his message, and so they do not have the eternal life that Jesus gives us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_19" data-id="EP4_19">They have chosen to do shameful things their bodies desire without stopping. They commit all kinds of immoral acts and are obsessed with them more and more, and they are greedy for anything they desire.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_20" data-id="EP4_20">But when you learned about Christ you did not learn to live like that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_21" data-id="EP4_21">Now that you have heard about Jesus and he has taught you, you know that his way is the true way to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_22" data-id="EP4_22">Jesus taught you to stop living the way you used to live, when you did what your evil desires deceived you into doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_23" data-id="EP4_23">You must let God change the way you think deep in your minds,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_24" data-id="EP4_24">and you must start living like the new persons that God made you to become. You must live righteously, set apart for God and living the way that is like the holy truth about Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_25" data-id="EP4_25">Therefore, quit lying to one another. Instead, speak truthfully to one another because we now are each other's fellow believers; we now belong to one another in God's family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_26" data-id="EP4_26">If you get angry, do not let your anger become sin. Before the end of the day, stop being angry</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_27" data-id="EP4_27">so that you will not allow the devil to tempt you to do evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_28" data-id="EP4_28">Those who have been stealing must not steal any longer. Instead, they must work hard to earn their living by their own efforts, so that they may have something to give to those who are needy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_29" data-id="EP4_29">Do not use foul language. Instead, say good things that will help people when they need help, things that help those who hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_30" data-id="EP4_30">Do not make the Holy Spirit of God sad by what you say or how you live, for He has sealed us with the promise of God's eternal protection for the day when God will deliver us from this world of evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_31" data-id="EP4_31">Do not be resentful at all toward others. Do not become angry in any way or shout abusively at others. Never slander others. Never plan evil toward others. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP4_32" data-id="EP4_32">Be kind to one another. Act mercifully toward each other. Forgive each other, just like God forgave you because of what Christ has done.</span>

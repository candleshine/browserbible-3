<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_1" data-id="JR8_1">Yahweh says, "After your enemies have destroyed you, then they will break open the graves of your kings and other officials who lived in Judah, and the graves of your priests and prophets and other people who lived there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_2" data-id="JR8_2">They will take out their bones from their graves and dishonor them by scattering them on the ground under the sun and the moon and the starsâ€”those are the gods which my people loved and served and worshiped. No one will gather up their bones and bury them again; they will remain scattered on the ground like dung.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_3" data-id="JR8_3">And all the people of this wicked nation who are still alive and whom I have exiled to other countries will say, 'We would prefer to die than to continue to stay alive here in these countries.' That will be true because I, Yahweh, have said it."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_4" data-id="JR8_4">Yahweh said to me, "Jeremiah, tell the people that this is what I, Yahweh, am saying to them: 'When people fall down, they get up again, do they not?</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_4" data-id="JR8_4">When people are going along a road and find out that they are walking on the wrong road, they go back and find the correct road, do they not ?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_5" data-id="JR8_5">Yes, they do, so why do these people of Judah continue trusting in those idols that have deceived them?</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_5" data-id="JR8_5">They continue turning away from me and betray my covenant, even though I have warned them of what will happen.</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_6" data-id="JR8_6">I have listened carefully to what they say, but they do not say what they should say. Not one of them is sorry for having sinned.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_6" data-id="JR8_6">No one says, "I have done wicked things." They are sinning and doing what they want to;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_6" data-id="JR8_6">Charging into sinful behavior with the excitement of a horse that is running into a battle.</span>

<span class="v JR8_8" data-id="JR8_8">So, why do they continue saying, "We are very wise because we have the laws of Yahweh"?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_9" data-id="JR8_9">Those teachers, who think that they are wise, will be ashamed and dismayed when they are taken to other countries by their enemies</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_9" data-id="JR8_9">Because they sinned by rejecting what I told them. Truly, they were not very wise to do that!</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR8_12" data-id="JR8_12">They should be ashamed when they do disgusting things, but they do not even know how to show on their faces that they are ashamed about their sins.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_12" data-id="JR8_12">So, they will be killed, and their corpses also will lie among the corpses of others who have been slaughtered by their enemies. They will be killed when I punish them.</span>

</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v JR8_14" data-id="JR8_14">Because Yahweh our God has decided that we must be destroyed; it is as though he has given us a cup of poison to drink, because we sinned against him.</span>

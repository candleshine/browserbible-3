<span class="v JR12_1" data-id="JR12_1">So now allow me to ask about one more thing that I do not understand:</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR12_1" data-id="JR12_1">Why are wicked people often very prosperous?</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR12_1" data-id="JR12_1">Why do things go very well for dishonest people?</span>

</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR12_2" data-id="JR12_2">but in their inner beings, they are really far from you.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR12_3" data-id="JR12_3">But Yahweh, as for me, you know what is in my inner being.</span>

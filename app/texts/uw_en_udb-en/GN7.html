<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN7_17" data-id="GN7_17">For forty days the water kept coming and the flood increased and lifted the boat up above the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN7_18" data-id="GN7_18">The rushing waters rose higher and higher on the earth, and the boat floated on the surface of the water.</span>

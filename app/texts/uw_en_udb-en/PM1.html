<div class="mt1">Philemon</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_1" data-id="PM1_1">I, Paul, am a prisoner who serves Christ Jesus. I am here with Timothy, our fellow believer. I am writing this letter to you, Philemon, our dear friend and fellow worker.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">I am also writing to Apphia, our fellow believer, and to Archippus, who is like a soldier who serves along with us. And I am writing to the group of believers that meets in your house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will continue to act kindly toward you all. I pray that he will continue to cause you to have peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">When I pray for you, I always thank God, </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">because I keep hearing about how you trust in the Lord Jesus. I also hear about how you keep on loving and helping all the believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">I pray that because you trust in Christ the same as we do, you may be able to know every good thing that we have to give you regarding Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">I have greatly rejoiced and have much courage  because you, my dear friend, have been loving God's people and helping them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">So I want to ask you to do something. I am completely confident that I have the authority to command you to do what you should do, because I am an apostle of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">But because I know that you love God's people, I request this instead of commanding you to do it. It is I, Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner because I serve Christ Jesus, who am requesting it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I request that you do something for Onesimus. He is now like a son of mine because I told him about Christ here in prison. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">Although his name, as you know, means "useful," he was useless to you in the past. But now he is useful both to you and to me!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">Although he is very dear to me, I am sending him back to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">I would like to have kept him with me, in order that he might serve me in your place.  I need him because I am in prison because of my preaching the message about Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">However, because I had not yet asked you and you had not yet permitted me to keep him here with me, I decided not to keep him here. I decided that you should help me only if you really want to help me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">Perhaps the reason that God permitted Onesimus to be separated from you was so you could have him back forever!</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">You will no longer have him only as a slave. Instead, you will have him as someone who is more than a slave. You will have him as a fellow believer! He is very dear to me, but he certainly will be even more dear to you. This is because now he not only belongs to you as a slave, but he also belongs to the Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">So if you believe that you and I are doing God's work together, welcome him as you would welcome me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">If he has done you any kind of harm, or if he is in debt to you, let me take the responsibility for that. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_19" data-id="PM1_19">I, Paul, am now writing this in my own handwriting: I will repay you what he owes you. I could say to you that you owe me even more than Onesimus owes you, because what I told you saved your own life.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_20" data-id="PM1_20">Indeed, my brother, cause me to rejoice with the Lord. Since we are both joined to Christ, make my heart glad.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_21" data-id="PM1_21">I have written this letter to you, because I am sure that you will do what I am asking you to do. In fact, I know that you will do even more than what I am asking you to do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_22" data-id="PM1_22">Also, get a guest room ready for me to stay in, because I confidently expect that as a result of your prayers for me, I will be released from prison and will come to you all.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_23" data-id="PM1_23">Epaphras, who is suffering with me in prison because he is joined to Christ Jesus, sends his greetings to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_24" data-id="PM1_24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, who are my other fellow workers, also send their greetings to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_25" data-id="PM1_25">I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will continue to be kind to you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_1" data-id="EC6_1">I have seen something else here on this earth that troubles people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_2" data-id="EC6_2">God enables some people to receive a lot of money and possessions and to be honored by him. They have everything that they want. But God sometimes does not allow them to enjoy those things. Someone else gets them and enjoys them. That seems senseless and unfair.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_3" data-id="EC6_3">Someone might have a hundred children and live for many years. But if he is not able to enjoy the things that he has acquired, and if he is not buried properly after he dies, I say that a child that is dead when it is born is more fortunate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_4" data-id="EC6_4">This is true, even though that dead baby's birth is meaningless—even though it does not have a name, and its brief life becomes only a sad memory in the future.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_5" data-id="EC6_5">That baby does not live to see the sun or know anything. But even so, it finds more rest than rich people do who are alive.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_6" data-id="EC6_6">Even if people should live for two thousand years, if they do not enjoy the things that God gives to them, it would have been better for them never to have been born.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC6_6" data-id="EC6_6">All people who live a long time certainly all go to the same place—to the grave.</span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_7" data-id="EC6_7">People work hard to earn enough money to buy food to eat,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_7" data-id="EC6_7">but often they never get enough to eat.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_8" data-id="EC6_8">So it seems that wise people do not receive more lasting benefits</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_8" data-id="EC6_8">than foolish people do.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC6_8" data-id="EC6_8">And it seems that poor people do not benefit from knowing how to conduct their lives.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">It is better to enjoy the things that we already have </span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">than to constantly want more things.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">Continually wanting more things is senseless,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">like trying to control the wind.</span>

</div>

<span class="v EC6_10" data-id="EC6_10">Everyone knows what people are like,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC6_10" data-id="EC6_10">so it is useless to argue with God,</span>

<span class="v EC6_10" data-id="EC6_10">who is stronger than we are.</span>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_11" data-id="EC6_11">The more that we talk,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_11" data-id="EC6_11">the more often we say things that are senseless,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_11" data-id="EC6_11">so it certainly does not benefit us to talk a lot.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_12" data-id="EC6_12">No human being can know everything that is good for himself in this life. People live for a few seemingly meaningless days. Life passes by quickly, like a shadow, and no one know what is coming after we die. We live for only a short time, and then we disappear like a vapor.</span>

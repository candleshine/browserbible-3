<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_1" data-id="MK11_1">When Jesus and his disciples came near to Jerusalem, they came to Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus called two of his disciples</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_2" data-id="MK11_2">and said to them, "Go to that village just ahead of us. As soon as you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_3" data-id="MK11_3">If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing that?' say, 'The Lord needs to use it. He will send it back here with someone as soon as he no longer needs it.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_4" data-id="MK11_4">So the two disciples went and found a young donkey. It was tied close to the door of a house, which was beside the street. Then they untied it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_5" data-id="MK11_5">Some of the people who were there said to them, "Why are you untying that donkey?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_6" data-id="MK11_6">They told them what Jesus had said. So the people permitted them to take the donkey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_7" data-id="MK11_7">The two disciples brought the donkey to Jesus and put their cloaks on it to make something for him to sit on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_8" data-id="MK11_8">Many people spread their cloaks on the road in front of him. Others cut branches from palm trees in nearby fields and spread them along the road.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_9" data-id="MK11_9">The people who were going in front of him and behind him were all shouting things like, "Praise God!" "May God bless this one who comes with his authority."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_10" data-id="MK11_10">"May you be blessed when you rule like our ancestor King David ruled!" "Praise God who is in the highest heaven!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_11" data-id="MK11_11">Jesus entered Jerusalem with them, and then he went into the temple courtyard. After he looked around at everything there, he left the city because it was already late in the afternoon. He returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_12" data-id="MK11_12">The next day, as Jesus and his disciples were leaving Bethany, he felt hungry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_13" data-id="MK11_13">He saw in the distance a fig tree with all its leaves, so he went to it to see if he could find any figs on it. But when he came to it, he found no fruit on it, because it was not yet the season for figs to appear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_14" data-id="MK11_14">He said to the tree, "No one will ever eat from you again." And the disciples heard this.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_15" data-id="MK11_15">Jesus and his disciples went back into Jerusalem and entered the temple courtyard. He saw people who were selling and buying animals for sacrifices. He chased those people from the temple courtyard. He also overturned the tables of those who were selling temple tax money in exchange for Roman coins. And he overturned the seats of the men who were selling doves for sacrifice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_16" data-id="MK11_16">He would not allow anyone who was carrying anything to sell to go through the temple area.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_17" data-id="MK11_17">Then as he taught those people, he said to them, "It is written in the Scriptures that God said, 'I want my house to be a house where people from all nations can pray,' but you bandits have made it like a cave where robbers hide."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_18" data-id="MK11_18">The chief priests and the men who taught the Jewish laws later heard about what he had done. They were planning how they might kill him, but they feared him because they realized that the crowd was amazed at what he was teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_19" data-id="MK11_19">Every evening Jesus and his disciples would leave the city.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_20" data-id="MK11_20">The next morning while they were going along the road toward Jerusalem, they saw that the fig tree that Jesus had cursed had withered completely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_21" data-id="MK11_21">Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the fig tree and he said to Jesus, "Teacher, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_22" data-id="MK11_22">Jesus replied, "Trust in God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_23" data-id="MK11_23">Also note this: If anyone says to this mountain, 'Be raised up and thrown into the sea!' and if he does not doubt that it will happen, that is, if he believes that it will happen, God will do it for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_24" data-id="MK11_24">So I tell you, whenever you ask God for something when you pray, believe that you will receive it, and, if you do, God will do it for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_25" data-id="MK11_25">Now, I tell you this also: Whenever you are praying, if you have a grudge against people because they have harmed you, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven will likewise forgive your sins."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_26" data-id="MK11_26"><span class="note" id="note-4"><a class="key" href="#footnote-4">4</a><span class="text">Some ancient authorities include:<em>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins. </em></span></span></span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_27" data-id="MK11_27">Jesus and his disciples arrived in the temple courtyard in Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking there, a group consisting of chief priests, some men who taught the Jewish laws, and elders came to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_28" data-id="MK11_28">They said to him, "By what authority are you doing these things? Who authorized you to do things like those you did here yesterday?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_29" data-id="MK11_29">Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you who authorized me to do those things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_30" data-id="MK11_30">Was it God or people who authorized John to baptize those who came to him? Or was it people who authorized him?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_31" data-id="MK11_31">They debated among themselves as to what they should answer. They said to each other, "If we say that it was God who authorized him, he will say to us, 'Then you should have believed what John said!'</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_32" data-id="MK11_32">On the other hand, if we say that it was people who authorized John, then what will happen to us?" They were afraid to say that about John, because they knew that the people would be very angry with them. They knew that all the people truly believed that John was a prophet whom God had sent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK11_33" data-id="MK11_33">So they answered Jesus, "We do not know who John got his authority from." Then Jesus said to them, "Because you did not answer my question, I will not tell you who authorized me to do those things here yesterday."</span>

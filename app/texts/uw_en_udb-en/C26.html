<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_1" data-id="C26_1">We work together, and we beg you not to receive the gift of God's love in a way that makes no difference for you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_2" data-id="C26_2">For God said, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C26_2" data-id="C26_2">"At a time when I displayed my loving mercy, I listened to you, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C26_2" data-id="C26_2">And when I completed the work of my salvation, I helped you."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v C26_2" data-id="C26_2">Look, this is the day when God is having mercy on you; this is the day that he is rescuing you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_3" data-id="C26_3">We certainly do not want to give anyone reason to do wrong, because we want no one to accuse us of preaching the good news in order to encourage evil doing. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_4" data-id="C26_4">We have proved again and again that we are God's true servants. We endure great suffering, we face with courage people who hurt us, and we live through hard times.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_5" data-id="C26_5">People have beaten us very badly; others have locked us up in prisons; we were the cause for people to riot; we have done hard physical labor; we have passed many long nights without sleep, and we have often gone with very little food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_6" data-id="C26_6">But in all this, our lives are pure, our knowledge is deep, and we are able to wait until God ends our suffering. We know how kind Christ is to us; we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and we love others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_7" data-id="C26_7">We live according to God's true Word, and we have God's power. By means of Christ, God has put us right with himself. This is the truth that we continuously believe; it is like armor that a soldier wears, and like weapons for both of his hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_8" data-id="C26_8">Sometimes people honor us; at other times, they dishonor us. Sometimes they say many evil things about us; at other times, they praise us. They accuse us of lying, even though we tell the truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_9" data-id="C26_9">We live like persons whom nobody knows, but some people know us very well. Some try to kill us for announcing the message about Christ, even though no one legally ever condemns us to death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_10" data-id="C26_10">We live with great sorrow but we always rejoice. We live as some of the poorest people, but we have the treasure of the good news that makes many rich. You can see that we own nothing, but the truth is that all things belong to us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_11" data-id="C26_11">You heard our testimony; we have spoken the whole the truth to you, fellow believers at Corinth. We have opened our hearts wide to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_12" data-id="C26_12">We have shown you that we freely love you,  but you seem to have closed off your hearts toward us.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_13" data-id="C26_13">It would be a fair exchange—I am speaking as to children—for you to love us in return. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_14" data-id="C26_14">Do not work in unsuitable ways with people who do not trust Christ. What do people who live by God's measure and rules have in common with those who break his laws and do what they want? Darkness and light cannot be together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_15" data-id="C26_15">How can Christ agree in any way with the demon Beliar? What does a person who trusts in God have in common with another person who does not trust in God? </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_16" data-id="C26_16">How right would it do to bring pagan idols into the temple of God? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:</span>

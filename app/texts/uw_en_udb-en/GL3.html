<div class="c">3</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_1" data-id="GL3_1">You fellow believers there in Galatia are very foolish! Someone must have bewitched you with their evil eye! I told you exactly how they had crucified Jesus Christ, did I not?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_2" data-id="GL3_2">So I want you to tell me only one thing: when the Holy Spirit came to you, did he come because you were obeying the law of Moses? Or did the Spirit come to you because you had heard the good news and trusted in Christ? Certainly this is what happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_3" data-id="GL3_3">You are very foolish! You first became Christians because God's Spirit enabled you. But now you think you will continue until you die by trying as hard as possible to obey the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_4" data-id="GL3_4">All the things you experienced after you believed in Christ--whether good things or bad things--they would have been of no value at all if you had not been trusting in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_5" data-id="GL3_5">When God now generously gives to you his Spirit and performs mighty deeds among you, do you think that it is because you obey God's law? Surely you know it is because when you heard the good news about Christ, you trusted in him!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_6" data-id="GL3_6">What you have experienced is just as Moses had written in the scriptures about Abraham. He wrote that Abraham trusted God, and as a result God declared Abraham  good in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_7" data-id="GL3_7">You should realize, therefore, that it is those who trust in Christ to save them whom God has made into descendants of Abraham.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_8" data-id="GL3_8">Ever before God began to make non-Jews good in his sight when they trusted in him, men wrote in the scriptures that he would do this. God announced this good news to Abraham, as we read in the scriptures, "Because of what you have done, I will bless all the people groups in the world."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_9" data-id="GL3_9">So, we know by this that it is all those who trust in Christ whom God blesses along with Abraham, who also trusted in God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_10" data-id="GL3_10">God curses all those who think they can please God by obeying his law. It is just as they wrote in the scriptures long ago, "God will eternally punish everyone who does not continuously and completely obey all the laws that they wrote in the Book of the law."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_11" data-id="GL3_11">But God has said that if he declares any people good in his sight, it will not be because they obeyed his law. This is evident because they wrote in the scriptures, "Every person whom God declares to be good  will live because he trusts God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_12" data-id="GL3_12">Whoever tries to obey the law is not trusting in Christ. Instead, they wrote in the scriptures, "Whoever starts to do the things in the law must obey them all."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_13" data-id="GL3_13">Christ stopped God from having to curse us as they wrote in the law he must. This happened when God cursed Christ in our place. It is like they wrote in the scriptures, "God curses everyone whom they hang on a tree."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_14" data-id="GL3_14">God cursed Christ in order to bless the non-Jews who believe in Christ just as he blessed Abraham. And he blessed the non-Jews so that we might receive the Spirit, whom he promised to all who trust in Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_15" data-id="GL3_15">My fellow believers, God's promise is like a contract between two people. After they sign it, no one can cancel it, nor can they add anything to it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_16" data-id="GL3_16">God promised to bless Abraham and his special descendant. The scriptures do not say, "your descendants," that is, many people, but instead "your descendant," meaning just one person, Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_17" data-id="GL3_17">This is what I am saying. God established an agreement with Abraham that the law which he gave to Moses 430 years later could not cancel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_18" data-id="GL3_18">This is because if what God is giving to us forever comes because we keep his law, then he would not be giving it because he had promised to do so. In reality, however, God gave Abraham this gift because he had freely promised to give it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_19" data-id="GL3_19">So why did God later give his law to us Jews? God gave us his law to teach us that we all deliberately break it. This law was in force until the descendant about whom he spoke--Jesus himself--came to us Jews. Until that time, the law that God's angels gave to us Jews by the hand of Moses, the man who stood between God and the people, was in force.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_20" data-id="GL3_20">When there is a person to go between others, then there are always two persons who are acting: in this case, God and the Israelites. But God acted by himself, without a go-between, when he promised to bless Abraham. Therefore, the Abrahamic promise is greater than the law because there was no mediator involved.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_21" data-id="GL3_21">So do the words of the law speak against what God promises? Certainly not. If we could obey the law and then live forever with God, then he certainly would have regarded us as good in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_22" data-id="GL3_22">But that was impossible. Instead, because we sin, the law in the scriptures controls us—and all things—just as if we were in prison. So when God promised to free us from that prison, he was speaking about anyone who believes in Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_23" data-id="GL3_23">Before God revealed the good news about how people should trust in Christ, his law was like a soldier who kept us in prison, unable to move about. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_24" data-id="GL3_24">Like a father protects his small child by telling a slave to take care of him, God was supervising us by his law until Christ came. He did this so that he might now declare us good in his sight, if we trust in Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_25" data-id="GL3_25">But now that we can trust in Christ, we do no longer need God's law to supervise us .</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_26" data-id="GL3_26">I say this because you are all God's children because you have trusted in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_27" data-id="GL3_27">All you who trust in Christ and were baptized so that you could join with him now have become the same sort of person as he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_28" data-id="GL3_28">If you are believers, it does not matter to God if you are Jews or non-Jews, slaves or free persons, males or females, because all of you are together joined to Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v GL3_29" data-id="GL3_29">Furthermore, since you belong to Christ, he makes you into descendants of Abraham, and you will receive everything that God has promised him and us.</span>

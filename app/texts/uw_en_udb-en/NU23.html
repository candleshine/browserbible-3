</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v NU23_3" data-id="NU23_3">Then Balaam went by himself to the top of a hill,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU23_4" data-id="NU23_4">and God appeared to him there. Balaam said to him, "We have built seven altars, and I have killed and burned a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice to you on each altar."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU23_5" data-id="NU23_5">Then Yahweh gave Balaam a message to give to King Balak. Then he said, "Go back and tell him what I told you."</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU23_14" data-id="NU23_14">So Balak took Balaam to a field on the top of Mount Pisgah. There, again he built seven altars and offered a young bull and a ram as a sacrifice on each altar.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU23_15" data-id="NU23_15">Then Balaam said to the king, "Stand here close to your burned offerings, while I go and talk with Yahweh."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU23_16" data-id="NU23_16">So Balaam did that, and Yahweh appeared to Balaam again and gave him another message. Then he said, "Go back to Balak and tell him that message."</span>

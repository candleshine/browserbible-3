<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_4" data-id="LV6_4">You must return to its owner what you have stolen or what someone has lent to you and you have not returned, or what you found that someone else had lost, or whatever you lied about.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_5" data-id="LV6_5">You must not only return anything like that to its owner, but you must also pay to the owner an additional one fifth of its value.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_6" data-id="LV6_6">You must also bring to the priest a ram to be an offering to me, in order that you will no longer be guilty. The ram that you bring must be one that has no defects, one that has the value that has been officially determined.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV6_7" data-id="LV6_7">Then the priest will offer that ram to be a sacrifice that will cause you to no longer be guilty, and I will forgive you for the wrong things that you did."</span>

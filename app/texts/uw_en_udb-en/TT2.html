<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_1" data-id="TT2_1">But you, Titus, you must teach the things that help people believe the truth about God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_2" data-id="TT2_2">The older men should control themselves all the time. They should live in a way that other people respect, and they should speak wisely. They should also believe the true things about God, love others truly, and continuously do these things.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_3" data-id="TT2_3">The older women, like the men, should live so that everyone knows that they respect God very much. They must not say bad things about other people, and they must not drink very much wine. But they should teach others what is good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_4" data-id="TT2_4">In this way, they should teach the younger women to think wisely and to love their own husbands and children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_5" data-id="TT2_5">The older women should also teach the younger women to think good thoughts, not to act in a bad way toward any man, to work well at home, and to do what their husbands tell them. They should do all these things so that no one will mock God's Word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_6" data-id="TT2_6">And concerning the younger men, teach them, too. Tell them to control themselves well.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_7" data-id="TT2_7">As for you,Titus, my son, always show others people how to do good deeds;  show them that you teach the believers honestly what is true and good and about God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_8" data-id="TT2_8">Teach people in a way that no one can criticize, so that if anybody wants to stop you, other people will shame him because he has nothing bad to say about us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_9" data-id="TT2_9">About our brothers and their families who are slaves: they should always submit to their masters. As much as possible, they should live in a way that pleases their masters in every way, and are they should not argue with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_10" data-id="TT2_10">They must not steal even little things from their masters; instead, they should be faithful to them, and they should do everything in a way that leads people to admire all that we teach about God, who saves us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_11" data-id="TT2_11">Titus, all that I have written adds up to this: everyone is now able to know that God wishes to save them; this is his gift to them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_12" data-id="TT2_12">This saving grace from God trains us, as if we were children, to say no to the desires that are found in this world. It helps us to think about things in the right way, to be honest, truthful, and fair to other people and to always keep God in our thoughts and actions while we live in this world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_13" data-id="TT2_13">At the same time, God teaches us to wait for what he will certainly do in the future, which is something that will make us very happy: That is, Jesus the Messiah, our Savior and powerful God, will return to us in great splendor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_14" data-id="TT2_14">He gave himself to die as the payment to free us from our lawless nature, to make us his cherished possession, a treasured people that he has made clean, a people whose greatest joy is to do what is good.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_15" data-id="TT2_15">Titus, speak about these things. Urge those who hear you to live as I have described. And use your full right of command to correct our brothers and sisters when it is necessary. Let no one disregard what you say.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_1" data-id="C11_1">I, Paul, am writing this letter. Sosthenes, our fellow believer, is with me as I write it. God appointed me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and God chose me to serve him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_2" data-id="C11_2">This letter is to the church of God in Corinth, to those whom Christ Jesus has set apart for God, with everyone else—everwhere—who calls on God to save them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours.  </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_3" data-id="C11_3">May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ love you and give you peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_4" data-id="C11_4">I thank my God every day for you, because of the many costly gifts that Christ Jesus has given to you because he loves you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_5" data-id="C11_5">Christ has given you so many things. He helped you to speak his truth and to know God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_6" data-id="C11_6">You yourselves stood by these statements as true, as you have spoken about Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_7" data-id="C11_7">I pray for you that you would not lack any gift from the Spirit of God while you wait for the day when God will make the Lord Jesus Christ known and will show him to everyone. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_8" data-id="C11_8">God will also make you strong so you can serve him to the very end, so you will bring no shame upon yourselves on the day that our Lord Jesus Christ returns to earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_9" data-id="C11_9">God will keep his promise to do that. God called you, so you can know and love his Son, Jesus Christ, who is our Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_10" data-id="C11_10">My brothers and sisters, I beg you by the authority of Jesus, that you come to an agreement and that you settle this argument, and that there be no more divisions among you. Learn to see things from the same point of view as you work to settle this argument and then you will find that you have the same goals in mind. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_11" data-id="C11_11">Those in Chloe's house reported to me that there had been divisions and disagreements among some of you. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_12" data-id="C11_12">This is the problem. Each of you claims to have loyalty to one leader or another. One says, "I am loyal to Paul." Another says, "I am loyal to Apollos."  Someone else says, "I am loyal to Peter." And the last one says, "But I am loyal to Christ." </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_13" data-id="C11_13">But Christ does not divide his loyalty. Paul was not crucified for you. The person who baptized you did not baptize you in the name of Paul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_14" data-id="C11_14">I thank God that I baptized only a few people there; among them I baptized Crispus and Gaius. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_15" data-id="C11_15">It would not be true that  I baptized them in my name. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_16" data-id="C11_16">(Now I remember that I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but other than those people, I do not remember baptizing anyone else in Corinth.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_17" data-id="C11_17">The most important reason Christ sent me was not to baptize people but to tell everyone the good news about him. I proclaimed the good news not so it was established by human wisdom and with the use of clever words, but so that the message is built on the foundation of the work of Christ when he died on the cross.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_18" data-id="C11_18">For those who are dead to the things of God cannot know him, the message about Christ dying on the cross is pointless to them. But for those of us whom God has rescued and brought to life, we know it is God's power working in us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">A prophet wrote in the Scriptures: </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">"The wisdom of those who think they are wise, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">I will destroy,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">and I will make the brilliant plans of the intelligent </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">to be utter failures."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_20" data-id="C11_20">Where are the wise people of this world? They did not understand anything  about God. Neither did the scholars, nor those skilled in debate. For God has shown that all their wisdom is foolishness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_21" data-id="C11_21">In the wisdom of God,  unbelievers did not come to know God by their own wisdom. So God was pleased to use a message that they thought was foolish. That is message we proclaimed and it had power to save all who believe it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_22" data-id="C11_22">The Jews wanted public displays of miraculous power before they would follow anyone. The Greeks are looking for wisdom through new and fresh ways of thinking about spiritual ideas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_23" data-id="C11_23">But we proclaim a message about Christ, who died on a cross. For the Jews this message about the cross of Christ is something they cannot receive because death on a cross brings a curse with it. To the Greeks it is too foolish to deserve their attention.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_24" data-id="C11_24">But for us, we whom God called so we can know him, Christ is his power to rescue from destruction and it is the wisdom to know God and to learn about him. The good news is not tied to any race or philosophy; in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and all the other nations and races on earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_25" data-id="C11_25">For what appears foolish to God is wiser that the most brilliant ideas human beings can imagine. And the weakest part of God's nature is stronger than the strongest and greatest human being who ever lived. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_26" data-id="C11_26">Brothers and sisters, look at the kind of person you were when God called you. See how unimportant you were. You were not the wisest of people. You were not important enough for people to obey you. You had no important ancestors.   </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_27" data-id="C11_27">Instead, God chose the things that made no sense to unbelievers, in order to stop them from praising themselves. God chose to use things that were weak, to put to shame the things they believed were so strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_28" data-id="C11_28">God chose what the unbelievers think is of no importance in order to show that the things they consider to be important, have no value. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_29" data-id="C11_29">God did this so that no human being could have any reason to praise himself and he should offer God all praise instead. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_30" data-id="C11_30">Because of what God has done, you are now joined to Christ Jesus, who has made clear to us how wise God is, he has put us right with God, he has set us apart for God, and he has rescued us and brought us to safety.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_31" data-id="C11_31">So, as the Scriptures say: </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_31" data-id="C11_31">"The one who praises himself should praise himself only in what the Lord has done for him."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_1" data-id="NM1_1">I am Nahum, from the village of Elkosh. This is a message about the city of Nineveh, a message that Yahweh gave me in a vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_2" data-id="NM1_2">Yahweh our God tolerates no rival gods to himself.  He is very angry with those who worship other gods,  and he continues to be angry with his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_3" data-id="NM1_3">Yahweh does not quickly become angry;  but he is very powerful,  and he will never say that his enemies are innocent.  Wherever he walks, there are whirlwinds and storms,  and clouds are like the dust stirred up by his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_4" data-id="NM1_4">When he commands oceans and rivers to become dry,  they dry up.  He causes the grass to wither in the fields in the region of Bashan and on the slopes of Mount Carmel,  and causes the flowers in Lebanon to fade.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_5" data-id="NM1_5">When he appears, it is as though the mountains shake and the hills melt;  the earth quakes, and the people on the earth tremble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_6" data-id="NM1_6">There is no one who can resist him when he becomes extremely angry;  there is no one who can survive when his anger is very hot.  When he is very angry, it is as though his anger is like a blazing fire,  and it is as though mountains are shattered into pieces.</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_7" data-id="NM1_7">But he is good;  he protects us, his people, when we experience troubles.  He takes care of those who trust in him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_8" data-id="NM1_8">But he will get rid of his enemies;  he will be to them like a flood that destroys everything.  He will chase his enemies  into the darkness of the place where the dead are.</span>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_9" data-id="NM1_9">So it is useless for you people of Nineveh to plot against Yahweh.  He will not need to strike you two times to destroy you;  he will destroy you by striking you only once.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_10" data-id="NM1_10">It will be as though his enemies are tangled in thorns  and they will stagger like people who have drunk a lot of wine.  It will be as though they will be burned up like dry stubble.</span>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_11" data-id="NM1_11">In Nineveh there was a man who advised people to do very wicked things against Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_12" data-id="NM1_12">But this is what Yahweh says to you Israelites:</span>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v NM1_12" data-id="NM1_12">"Although the people of Assyria have very many people and their army is very powerful,</span>
  they will be destroyed and will disappear.  I say to my people in Judah,  I have already punished you,  but I will not punish you again.<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_13" data-id="NM1_13">Now I will cause the people of Assyria to no longer enslave you;  it will be as though I will tear off the shackles on your hands and feet."</span>

<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_14" data-id="NM1_14">And this is what Yahweh also declares about you people of Nineveh:</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v NM1_14" data-id="NM1_14">"You will not have any descendants who will continue to have your family names.</span>
  And I will destroy all the statues of your gods  that were carved or formed in molds.  I will cause you to be killed and sent to your graves,  because you are vile!"</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM1_15" data-id="NM1_15">You people of Judah. Look! A messenger will come across the mountains,  and he will bring good news to you.  He will declare that you will now have peace.  So celebrate your festivals,  and do what you solemnly promised to do when your enemies were threatening to attack you,  because your wicked enemies will not invade your country again,  because they will be completely destroyed.</span>

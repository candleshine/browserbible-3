<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_1" data-id="S21_1">After Saul died, David and the men who were with him returned to the town of Ziklag after defeating the descendants of Amalek. They stayed in Ziklag for two days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_2" data-id="S21_2">On the third day, a man unexpectedly arrived there who had been in Saul's army. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show that he was grieving. He came to David and prostrated himself on the ground in front of David to show respect for him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_3" data-id="S21_3">David asked him, "Where have you come from?" The man replied, "From the Israelite army."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_4" data-id="S21_4">David asked him, "What happened? Tell me about the battle!" The man replied, "Our soldiers ran away. Many of them were killed. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_5" data-id="S21_5">David said to the young man, "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_6" data-id="S21_6">The young man replied, "I was on Mount Gilboa where the fighting was. I saw Saul; he was leaning on his spear. The enemy chariots and their drivers were coming very close to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_7" data-id="S21_7">Saul turned around and saw me, and he called out to me. I answered him and said, 'What do you want me to do?'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_8" data-id="S21_8">He replied, 'Who are you?' I replied, 'I am a descendant of Amalek.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_9" data-id="S21_9">Then he said to me, 'Come over here and kill me. I am in very much pain.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_10" data-id="S21_10">So I went to him and killed him, because I saw that he was wounded very badly and would not continue to live. I took the crown from his head and his armband, which I have brought to you, my master."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_11" data-id="S21_11">Then David and all the men who were with him tore their clothes to show that they were very sad.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_12" data-id="S21_12">They mourned for Saul and his son Jonathan, and they cried and fasted; they would continue to do that until evening.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_13" data-id="S21_13">But David asked the young man who had told him about the battle, "Where are you from?" He replied, "My father is a descendant of Amalek, but we live in Israel."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_14" data-id="S21_14">David asked him, "Why were you not afraid that you would be punished if you killed Saul, whom Yahweh made king? </span>
<span class="v-num v-15-16">15-16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_15-16" data-id="S21_15-16">You yourself said, 'I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.'

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_17" data-id="S21_17">Then David composed this sad song about Saul and Jonathan,</span>

<div class="c">4</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">I thought some more about all the suffering that people are made to experience on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">I thought about the tears of people who were oppressed</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">and who had no one to comfort them.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">Those who oppress them have power,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">and there is no one able to comfort the oppressed.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">So I thought that those who are already dead are more fortunate</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">than those who are still alive.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">And those who have not yet been born</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">are even more fortunate than those two kinds of people,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">because those who have not been born have not seen all the evil things that are done on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_4" data-id="EC4_4">I also thought about all the hard work that people do and the things they are able to accomplish. And I thought about how someone who works hard sometimes makes his neighbor jealous. I decided that this also is something that is not accomplishing anything useful. It is like trying to control the wind.</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">Foolish people refuse to work.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">They sit idly with their hands folded and do not work.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">So they ruin themselves.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">So some say, "It is better to be content with working quietly for a little bit of money,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">than to work anxiously and try to get a lot of money,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">which is as useless as trying to control the wind."</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_7" data-id="EC4_7">I thought about something else that happens on the earth that seems useless.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There are people who live alone;</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">they do not have a family nor even children or any brothers or sisters living with them.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">Every day they work very hard without stopping; they make a lot of money,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">but they are never satisfied with the things that they get.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">They ask themselves,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">"Why am I working so hard; whom am I actually helping?</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">Why am I not doing things that I would enjoy doing?</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">What I have been doing seems useless." This is very bad.</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_9" data-id="EC4_9">Having someone work with you is better than being by yourself all the time.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_9" data-id="EC4_9">If you have a friend, he can help you to do your work.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">If you fall down, he can help you get up again.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">But if you fall down when you are alone, you will have trouble,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">because there is no one to help you stand up.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">Similarly, if two people lie down together,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">they can help each other to remain warm.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">But someone who sleeps alone will certainly not be warm.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">Someone who is alone can easily be attacked and defeated by another person,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">but two people can help each other and resist someone who attacks them.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">Three people can defend themselves even more easily,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">like a rope that is made from three cords is harder to break than a rope made from two cords.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_13" data-id="EC4_13">A young man who is poor but wise is a better person than a foolish old king who refuses to pay attention when people try to give him good advice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_14" data-id="EC4_14">It is possible for a young man like that to succeed and some day become king, even if his parents were poor or even if he was in prison in the past.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_15" data-id="EC4_15">But then some other young man becomes king, and everyone starts to support him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_16" data-id="EC4_16">Large crowds of people crowd around him. But after a few years, they will be tired of him, too. So it is all senseless, like trying to control the wind.</span>

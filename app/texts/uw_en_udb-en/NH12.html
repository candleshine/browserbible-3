They wrote the names of the families who were descendants of Levi. When Darius was the king of Persia, the priests were responsible for recording who were the heads of families.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_23" data-id="NH12_23">They wrote the names of the leaders of the families who were descendants of Levi in the book of the annals. They recorded the events until the time Eliashib's grandson Johanan was the leader of all the priests.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_24" data-id="NH12_24">These are the leaders of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their brothers who stood across from them to praise and give thanks to God. They did that just as King David, the man who served God, had instructed them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_25" data-id="NH12_25">Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were the gatekeepers. They stood guard at the storerooms close to the gates of the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_26" data-id="NH12_26">They did that work during the time of Joiakim son of Jeshua and the grandson of Jehozadak, during the time of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest. Ezra also knew the Jewish laws very well.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_27" data-id="NH12_27">When we dedicated the wall around Jerusalem, we summoned the descendants of Levi from the places around Israel where they lived, so they could come to celebrate the dedication of the wall. They would sing songs to thank God and many of them made music by playing cymbals and harps and other stringed instruments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_28" data-id="NH12_28">We summoned the descendants of Levi who constantly sang together. They came to Jerusalem from nearby areas where they had settled, and from places around Netophah, southeast of Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_29" data-id="NH12_29">They came also from three places northeast of Jerusalem, Beth Gilgal and the areas around Geba and Azmaveth. Near Jerusalem the singers built villages where they lived.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_30" data-id="NH12_30">The priests and descendants of Levi performed rituals to make them clean in God's eyes, and they did the same for all the people, and even for the gates of the city and finally, for the wall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_31" data-id="NH12_31">Then I gathered together the leaders of Judah on top of the wall, and I appointed them to lead two large groups to march around the city on top of the wall, thanking God. As they faced the city, one group walked to the right toward the Dung Gate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_32" data-id="NH12_32">Behind their leaders marched Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_33" data-id="NH12_33">Those who followed after them were Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_34" data-id="NH12_34">Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_35" data-id="NH12_35">and some of the priests' sons who played their trumpets, including  Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph. </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_36" data-id="NH12_36">Behind them marched other members of Zechariah's family, including  Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They all were playing the same kinds of musical instruments that King David had played many years previously. Ezra, the man who knew the Jewish laws very well, marched in front of this group.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_37" data-id="NH12_37">When they reached the Fountain Gate, they went up the steps to the city of David, past the location of David's palace, and then to the wall at the Water Gate, on the east side of the city.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_38" data-id="NH12_38">The other choir who were singing and thanking Yahweh marched to the left on top of the wall. I followed them with half of the people. We marched past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_39" data-id="NH12_39">From there we marched past Ephraim Gate, Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred Soldiers, to the Sheep Gate. We finished marching near the gate into the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_40" data-id="NH12_40">Both the groups reached the house of God as they were singing and thanking him. They stood in their places there. I and the leaders who were with me also stood in our places.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_41" data-id="NH12_41">My group included these priests who were all blowing trumpets: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah,</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_42" data-id="NH12_42">another Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers, whose leader was Jezrahiah, sang loudly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_43" data-id="NH12_43">After we went outside the temple, we offered many sacrifices. We men all rejoiced because God had caused us to be very happy. The women and the children also rejoiced. People far away could hear the noise that we made there in Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_44" data-id="NH12_44">On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people gave for the temple. They also were in charge of the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. They also brought into the storerooms a part of the harvest from the fields for the priests and the descendants of Levi. This was done because the people of Judah were so happy to have servants serving in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_45" data-id="NH12_45">The priests and Levites were serving Yahweh in their rituals to purify things, and the  musicians in the temple and the gatekeepers also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_46" data-id="NH12_46">Ever since the time of David and Asaph, there have been directors and singers, and they sang songs to praise and thank God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH12_47" data-id="NH12_47">During the years of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, all Israel contributed the food that the singers and temple gatekeepers needed every day. They set aside what the Levites needed to live on, and the Levites set aside for the descendants of Aaron, the first leader of all the priests, what they needed.</span>

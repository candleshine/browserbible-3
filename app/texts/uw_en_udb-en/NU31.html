<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_1" data-id="NU31_1">Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_2" data-id="NU31_2">"Tell the Israelite people that they should pay back the Midian people group for what they did to you. After that happens, you will die."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_3" data-id="NU31_3">So Moses said to the people, "Get some men prepared for battle. Yahweh will enable them to pay back the Midian people group for what they did to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_4" data-id="NU31_4">Select a thousand men from each tribe to fight."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_5" data-id="NU31_5">So twelve thousand men prepared for fighting in the battle, one thousand from each tribe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_6" data-id="NU31_6">When Moses sent them to the battle, Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, went with them. He took with him some of the things from the sacred tent and the trumpets that would be blown to give the signal to start the battle.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_7" data-id="NU31_7">The Israelite men fought the soldiers from the Midian people group, as Yahweh had told Moses to tell them to do, and they killed every man from the Midian people group.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_8" data-id="NU31_8">Among those whom they killed were the five kings of the Midian people groupâ€”Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam with a sword son of Beor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_9" data-id="NU31_9">They captured all the women and children of the Midian people group and took away their cattle, their flocks of sheep, and herds of goats, and all their other possessions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_10" data-id="NU31_10">Then they burned down all the houses in the towns and villages where the people of the Midian people group lived,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_11" data-id="NU31_11">but they took home with them all the women and children and animals and possessions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_12" data-id="NU31_12">They brought all these to Eleazer and Moses, and to the rest of the Israelite people who were at their camp on the plains of Moab, near the Jordan River, across from Jericho.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_13" data-id="NU31_13">Eleazar and all the leaders of the people and Moses went outside the camp to greet them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_14" data-id="NU31_14">But Moses was angry with some of the men who had returned from the battle. He was angry with the army officers and the men who were commanders of a thousand men and those who were commanders of a hundred men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_15" data-id="NU31_15">He asked them, "Why did you allow the women to live?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_16" data-id="NU31_16">They are the ones who did what Balaam suggested and urged our people to worship Baal instead of Yahweh. As a result, Yahweh caused a plague to strike his people while they were at Peor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_17" data-id="NU31_17">So, now you must kill all the boys of the Midian people group, and also kill all the women who have slept with any man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_18" data-id="NU31_18">Spare only the girls who are virgins. You can keep them to be your wives or your slaves.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_19" data-id="NU31_19">All of you who have killed someone or touched the corpse of someone who was killed in the battle must stay outside the camp for seven days. On the third day and on the seventh day, you must perform the ritual to enable you to become acceptable to God again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_20" data-id="NU31_20">You must also wash your clothes and anything that you took to the battle that is made of leather or goat's hair or wood."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_21" data-id="NU31_21">Then Eleazar said to the soldiers who had returned from the battle, "This is what Yahweh has instructed Moses. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_22" data-id="NU31_22">You must put into a fire any gold or silver or bronze or iron or tin or lead things that you brought back from the battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_23" data-id="NU31_23">Put everything that will not burn into the fire, and then they will be acceptable for you to use. But also sprinkle those things with the water that causes things and people to become acceptable to God. The things that would burn if you put them in a fire, sprinkle them with that water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_24" data-id="NU31_24">On the seventh day, wash your clothes, and then you will become acceptable to God again. After you do that, you may return to the camp."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_25" data-id="NU31_25">Yahweh also said to Moses,</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_27" data-id="NU31_27">Then they must divide all those things between the men who fought in the battle and the rest of the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_28" data-id="NU31_28">From the men who fought in the battle, take one from every five hundred people and from every five hundred cattle and donkeys and sheep, to be a tax for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_29" data-id="NU31_29">Take these things to Eleazar to be my share as the offering presented to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_30" data-id="NU31_30">And from the other things, take one item from every fifty. That includes people, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give those things to the descendants of Levi who take care of my sacred tent."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_31" data-id="NU31_31">So Eleazar and Moses did what Yahweh commanded.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32-35">32-35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_32-35" data-id="NU31_32-35">There were 675,000 sheep, 72,000 cattle, 61,000 donkeys, and 32,000 virgins that they had captured from the Midian people group.</span>

<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_37" data-id="NU31_37">and they gave 675 of them to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_38" data-id="NU31_38">They took 36,000 cattle and gave 72 of them to Yahweh.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42-46">42-46&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_42-46" data-id="NU31_42-46">Moses separated what those who had fought in the battle received from what the other people received. The people received  337,500 sheep, 36,000 cattle, 30,500 donkeys, and 16,000 virgins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_47" data-id="NU31_47">From what the people received, Moses took one from every fifty items and gave them to Yahweh. That included animals and people. As Yahweh commanded, Moses gave them all to the descendants of Levi who took care of the sacred tent.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_48" data-id="NU31_48">Then the army officers and those who commanded a thousand men and those who commanded a hundred men came to Moses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_49" data-id="NU31_49">They said, "We, who are your servants, have counted the soldiers whom we command, and we found that none of them is missing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_50" data-id="NU31_50">So to thank Yahweh for that, we have brought to him a gift of the gold items that we found after the battle, gold arm bands and bracelets and rings, earrings and necklaces. We hope that this will atone for our sins."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU31_51" data-id="NU31_51">So Eleazar and Moses accepted the gold items that they brought.</span>

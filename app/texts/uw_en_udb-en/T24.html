<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_1" data-id="T24_1">When Christ Jesus comes soon to rule, he will judge those who still live and those who died. And now he and God are watching me as I command you</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_2" data-id="T24_2">to proclaim the message about Christ. Be ready to do this when it is easy to do so and also when it is not easy. Convince people about what is right when they have done wrong. Warn them not to sin. Encourage them to follow Christ. Do these things as you teach them, and always be willing to wait for them to do better. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_3" data-id="T24_3">I tell you these things, because the time will come when people among us will not follow what God truly teaches. Instead, they will find many men who will teach that it is good to do anything they wish to do. In this way, they will always be looking for something new and different to learn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_4" data-id="T24_4">They will stop listening to the truth, and they will pay attention to foolish stories. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_5" data-id="T24_5">But as for you, Timothy, control yourself no matter what happens. Be willing to endure difficult things. Do the work of preaching the Gospel. Complete the work you must do to serve the Lord.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_6" data-id="T24_6">I tell you these things, because soon I will die and leave this world. I will be like the cup of wine that they pour out on the altar and sacrifice to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_7" data-id="T24_7">I am like an athlete who has done his best in a contest. I am like a runner who has finished his race. I have done my best to obey God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_8" data-id="T24_8">Now a prize is waiting for me because I have lived in the right way for God. The Lord will judge me in the right way. He will give that prize to me when he comes again. And he will give it also to everyone who waits eagerly for him to come again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_9" data-id="T24_9">Timothy, try to come to me soon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_10" data-id="T24_10">Demas left me behind and went to Thessalonica, because he loves life in this world too much. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus went to Dalmatia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_11" data-id="T24_11">Only Luke is still with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. Do this  because he can help me very much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_12" data-id="T24_12">I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_14" data-id="T24_14">Alexander the metalworker acted very badly toward me. The Lord will punish him for what he has done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_15" data-id="T24_15">You also should be on guard against him because he did everything possible to stop our preaching.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_16" data-id="T24_16">The first time I stood in court and explained my work, no believers stood by my side to encourage me. They all stayed away. May God not hold them responsible for this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_17" data-id="T24_17">But the Lord stood with me and helped me. He made me strong, so that I fully spoke his word and so that all the Gentiles listened to it. In this way God saved me from dying. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_18" data-id="T24_18">The Lord will rescue me from every evil thing they do. He will bring me safely to where he rules in heaven. May people praise him forever. Amen. </span>

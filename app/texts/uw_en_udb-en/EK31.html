<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_1" data-id="EK31_1">Almost eleven years after the Babylonians had taken us Israelites to their land, Yahweh gave me another message, on the first day of the third month of that year. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_2" data-id="EK31_2">"Son of man, say to the king of Egypt and all of his servants,</span>
</div>

<span class="v EK31_2" data-id="EK31_2">'You think that there is no country whose power is as great as the power of your country.</span>

<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">You think that your country is as great as Assyria was.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">Well, Assyria was like a tall cedar tree in Lebanon;</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">it had big beautiful branches</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">that provided shade for other trees in the forest.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">It was very tall;</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_3" data-id="EK31_3">its top reached above the leaves of the other trees.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">Water came to it from deep springs,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">and as a result that cedar tree grew tall and very green.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">Then water flowed around the base of the tree</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_4" data-id="EK31_4">into channels that took water to other nearby trees.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_5" data-id="EK31_5">That huge tree grew very tall,</span>

<span class="v EK31_5" data-id="EK31_5">higher than all the other trees around it.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_5" data-id="EK31_5">Its branches grew very thick and long </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_5" data-id="EK31_5">because of the abundant water at the base of the tree.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_6" data-id="EK31_6">Birds built their nests in the branches,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_6" data-id="EK31_6">and wild animals gave birth to their young under those branches.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_6" data-id="EK31_6">And it was as though people of all the great nations lived in the shade of that tree.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_7" data-id="EK31_7">It was majestic and beautiful;</span>

<span class="v EK31_7" data-id="EK31_7">its branches spread out widely</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_7" data-id="EK31_7">because the roots of the tree grew down into the ground where there was a plentiful supply of water.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_8" data-id="EK31_8">The cedar trees in my garden in Eden were not as great as that tree,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_8" data-id="EK31_8">and the branches of the fir trees were not as long and thick as the branches of that cedar tree.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_8" data-id="EK31_8">And the branches of the plane trees were not as long and thick, either.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_8" data-id="EK31_8">No tree in my garden was as beautiful as that cedar tree.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_9" data-id="EK31_9">Because I caused that tree to become very beautiful</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EK31_9" data-id="EK31_9">because of its magnificent green branches,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EK31_9" data-id="EK31_9">all the leaders of other countries represented by those other trees in Eden envied the country represented by that tree.'</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_10" data-id="EK31_10">Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say: 'That tree, which represents Assyria, grew very tall; its top was higher than the other trees, and it became very proud because it was so tall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_11" data-id="EK31_11">Therefore, I enabled another mighty nation to conquer it, to destroy it as it deserved to be destroyed. I have already discarded it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_12" data-id="EK31_12">A foreign army, one that has caused people of other nations to be terrified, cut it down and left it. Its branches fell on the mountains and in the valleys. Some of its branches lay broken in all the ravines in the land. All the people of other nations came out from being under its shade and left it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_13" data-id="EK31_13">Birds settled on the fallen tree, and wild animals lived among its branches. This is what other nations were like when they depended on Assyria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_14" data-id="EK31_14">The result of what I have done is that no other tree—no other nation, even if the tree has plenty of water, will ever grow very high and become proud, or lift its top above the branches of other trees. I do not want any other nation to become as strong as that nation did; nations will all certainly die and decay, as people die and go down to their graves."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_15" data-id="EK31_15">This is what Yahweh the Lord says: "When that great tree was cut down, it was as though the springs that watered it mourned for it, because I caused the plentiful water from the springs to dry up. It was as if I had caused the mountains in Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees there to weep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_16" data-id="EK31_16">I caused the people of other nations to tremble when they heard that tree fall to the ground—when they heard that Assyria had been destroyed. All the other people groups had also been like beautiful, well-watered trees in Lebanon, but they were comforted when the king represented by that cedar tree arrived among them in the place where they were as dead people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_17" data-id="EK31_17">The people represented by the trees that grew in the shade of that  huge tree, the allies of the great nation that the cedar tree represents, had also died and gone down to where the dead people are.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK31_18" data-id="EK31_18">This parable is a warning to you people of Egypt. You think that there is no other nation that is as great and glorious as yours is. But your nation will also be destroyed, along with those other nations. Your people will be there among the other people who are not fit to worship me, people who have been killed by their enemies' swords. That is what will happen to the king of Egypt and all his servants." This is what the Lord Yahweh has declared will happen.</span>

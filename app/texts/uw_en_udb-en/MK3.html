<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_1" data-id="MK3_1">On another Sabbath Jesus again went into a synagogue. There was a man there whose hand was shriveled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_2" data-id="MK3_2">Some men of the Pharisee sect watched him carefully in order to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath; they wanted to be able to accuse him of doing something wrong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_3" data-id="MK3_3">Jesus said to the man whose hand was shriveled, "Stand up here in front of everyone!" So the man stood up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_4" data-id="MK3_4">Then Jesus said to the people, "Do the laws that God gave Moses permit people to do good on the Sabbath, or do evil?  Do the laws permit us to save a person's life on the Sabbath, or permit us to refuse to help a person and let them die?" But they did not reply.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_5" data-id="MK3_5">He looked around at them angrily. He was very disappointed that they were stubborn and not willing to help the man. So he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand!" When the man stretched out his withered hand, it became all right again!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_6" data-id="MK3_6">The Pharisees left the synogogue.  They immediately met with some of the Jews who supported Herod Antipas, who ruled the district of Galilee. Together they planned how they could kill Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_7" data-id="MK3_7">Jesus and his disciples left that town and went to an area further along the sea of Galilee. A great crowd of people followed him. The people that followed him came from Galilee and Judea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_8" data-id="MK3_8">from Jerusalem, from towns in the district of Judea, from the district of Idumea, from the region on the east side of the Jordan River, and from the region around the cities of Tyre and Sidon. They all came to him because they had heard about what he was doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9-10">9-10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_9-10" data-id="MK3_9-10">Because he had healed many people, many other people who had various illnesses pushed forward in order to touch him.  They believed that if only they touched him, it would make them well. So he told his disciples that they should get a small boat ready for him in order that the crowd would not crush him when they pushed forward to touch him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_11" data-id="MK3_11">Whenever the evil spirits saw Jesus, they caused the people whom they controlled to fall down in front of Jesus and call out to him, "You are the Son of God!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_12" data-id="MK3_12">Jesus commanded the evil spirits strongly that they should not tell anyone who he was.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_13" data-id="MK3_13">Jesus went up into the hills. As he went, he called out to those that he wanted to go with him and they went with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_14" data-id="MK3_14">He appointed twelve men to be with him and for him to send them out to preach. He called them apostles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_15" data-id="MK3_15">He also gave them power in order that they might force evil spirits to come out from people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_16" data-id="MK3_16">These were the twelve men he appointed: Simon, to whom he gave the new name Peter; </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_17" data-id="MK3_17">James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James, to both of whom he added the new name, 'Men who are like Thunder' because of their fiery zeal;</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_18" data-id="MK3_18">Andrew, Peter's brother; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; another James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_19" data-id="MK3_19">and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_20" data-id="MK3_20">Jesus and his disciples went to a house. Again a crowd gathered where he was staying. Many people crowded around him. He and his disciples did not even have time to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_21" data-id="MK3_21">When his relatives heard about this, they went to take him home with them because some people were saying that he was insane.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_22" data-id="MK3_22">Some men who taught the Jewish laws came down from Jerusalem. They heard that Jesus was forcing evil spirits to come out of people. So they were telling people, "Beelzebul, who rules the evil spirits, controls Jesus. He is the one who gives Jesus the power to force evil spirits out from people!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_23" data-id="MK3_23">So Jesus called those men over to himself. Jesus spoke to them in parables and said, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_24" data-id="MK3_24">If people who live in the same country are fighting against one another, their country will cease to be a united country.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_25" data-id="MK3_25">And if people who live in the same house fight each other, they will certainly not remain united as one family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_26" data-id="MK3_26">Similarly, if Satan and his evil spirits were fighting one another, instead of remaining strong, he would become powerless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_27" data-id="MK3_27">No one can go into the house of a strong man and take his possessions away from him unless he first ties up the strong man. Only then will he be able to steal the things in that man's house."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_28" data-id="MK3_28">Jesus also said, "Consider this carefully! People may sin in many ways and they may speak evil about God. God can still forgive them, </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_29" data-id="MK3_29">but if anyone speaks evil words about the Holy Spirit, God will never forgive them. That person is eternally guilty of sin."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_30" data-id="MK3_30">Jesus told them this because they were saying, "An evil spirit is controlling him!"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_31" data-id="MK3_31">Jesus' mother and younger siblings arrived. While they stood outside, they sent someone inside in order to call him outside.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_32" data-id="MK3_32">A crowd was sitting around Jesus. One of them said to him, "Your mother and younger siblings are outside. They want to see you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_33" data-id="MK3_33">Jesus asked  them, "Who is my mother? Who are my siblings?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_34" data-id="MK3_34">After he looked around at those who sat with him, he said, "Look here! You are my mother and my siblings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK3_35" data-id="MK3_35">Those who do what God wants are my brother, my sister, or my mother!"</span>

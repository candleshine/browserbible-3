<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_3" data-id="NM2_3">The shields of the enemy soldiers who are coming to attack you will shine red as the sun shines on them,  and they will wear bright red uniforms.  The metal of their chariot wheels will flash when they line up before the battle,  and their soldiers will lift up their cypress spear and wave them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NM2_4" data-id="NM2_4">Their chariots dash through the streets of Nineveh  and rush furiously through the plazas.  Going as quickly as lightning,  they look like flaming torches.</span>

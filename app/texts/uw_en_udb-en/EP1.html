<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_1" data-id="EP1_1">Dear fellow believers who God has set apart for himself, who are loyal to Christ Jesus—who are living in the city of Ephesus; this is Paul, whom God has chosen to send to you as an apostle of Christ Jesus</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_2" data-id="EP1_2">I pray that God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord will give you his kindness and peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_3" data-id="EP1_3">Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He has caused us great joy through every kind of heavenly, spiritual blessing that Christ gives to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_4" data-id="EP1_4">Before God created the world he chose us to be his people through Christ, who set us apart for God to live blamelessly in his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_5" data-id="EP1_5">Because he loves us, God planned long ago to adopt us as his own children because of what Jesus Christ has done. He planned to adopt us because it pleased him to have us as his children, so he did what he wanted to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_6" data-id="EP1_6">Because of this we now praise God for his amazing kindness given to us by his Son whom he loves, kindness that we did not deserve.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_7" data-id="EP1_7">Jesus has freed us as if he purchased us out of a slave market. He freed us by his death; that is, God has forgiven us of our sins, because he has been very, very kind to us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_8" data-id="EP1_8">He has been very kind to us, and he has given us every kind of wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_9" data-id="EP1_9">God has now explained the secret of his plan, as he was pleased to reveal Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_10" data-id="EP1_10">God planned that at the time that he appointed he would unite all things in heaven and all things on earth, and Christ would be the one who will rule them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_11" data-id="EP1_11">Long ago God chose us to be joined to Christ, just as he had planned—and he always does exactly what he wishes to do. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_12" data-id="EP1_12">He did those so that the Jews, who confidently expected the Messiah to come and save them before the non-Jews knew anything about Christ, would praise him for his kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_13" data-id="EP1_13">Now you Ephesians and other non-Jews have heard the true message, the good news that Jesus saves everyone who believes him. And you have believed in Christ, so it is as if God's Spirit had marked you on your foreheads to show that you belong to God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_14" data-id="EP1_14">The Holy Spirit is proof that we will receive all that God has promised. All this is great reason to praise him!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_15" data-id="EP1_15">Because God has done so much for you, and because I heard how you trust in the Lord Jesus and love all whom God has chosen for himself,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_16" data-id="EP1_16">I have not stopped thanking God for you and praying for you often. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_17" data-id="EP1_17">I pray that God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father who lives in shining light, may help you think wisely and to understand everything about what he reveals to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_18" data-id="EP1_18">I pray that God may teach you about what he wants to do for us, and why we know he is speaking the truth. I pray that we may know how great are the things he promises to give to us and to everyone whom he will choose to belong to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_19" data-id="EP1_19">And I pray that you will know how very powerfully God acts for us who are trusting in Christ. He works powerfully for us,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_20" data-id="EP1_20">just like he acted powerfully for Christ when he caused Christ to become alive again after he died, and raised him to the place of highest honor in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_21" data-id="EP1_21">In that place, Christ rules as supreme over every powerful spirit on every level of authority and over every name that exists. Jesus is much higher than any other being, not only now, but forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_22" data-id="EP1_22">God has put all beings under the rule of Christ, as if they were all under his feet. And God has appointed Christ as the ruler over everything among all believers everywhere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP1_23" data-id="EP1_23">It is as if all believers together were Christ's own body. He fills all believers everywhere with his power, just as he fills all the universe with his power.</span>

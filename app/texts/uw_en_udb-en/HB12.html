<div class="c">12</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_1" data-id="HB12_1">We know about many people like these who proved that they trusted in God. So we also must put away everything that hinders us. Especially we must stop doing anything that would keep us back, like a runner who takes off his clothes. Then let us patiently do everything that God gives us to do until we cross the finish line.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_2" data-id="HB12_2">And let us keep thinking about Jesus, as a runner keeps his eyes on the goal. He is the one whom we trust because he endured the intense suffering on the cross and ignored people who shamed him. He did this because he knew how joyful this would make others. He now sits at the place of highest honor beside the throne where God rules in heaven.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_3" data-id="HB12_3">Jesus patiently endured it when sinful people hatefully acted against him. Strengthen your hearts and minds with Jesus' example so that you will not give up trusting God or become discouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_4" data-id="HB12_4">While you have struggled against being tempted to sin, you have not yet bled and died because of resisting evil, as Jesus did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">Do not forget these words that Solomon spoke to his son, which are the same with which God encourages you as his children:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">"My child, pay attention when the Lord is disciplining you,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_5" data-id="HB12_5">and do not be discouraged when the Lord punishes you,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_6" data-id="HB12_6">because everyone whom the Lord loves he also disciplines,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB12_6" data-id="HB12_6">and he punishes everyone whom he accepts as his child."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_7" data-id="HB12_7">God may discipline you by requiring you to endure difficult things that happen to you. When God disciplines you, he is treating you as a father treats his children. All fathers discipline their children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_8" data-id="HB12_8">So if you have not experienced God disciplining you like he disciplines all his children, you are not true children of God. You are like illegitimate children who have no father to correct them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_9" data-id="HB12_9">Furthermore, our natural fathers disciplined us when we were young, and we respected them for doing that. So we should certainly more readily accept God our spiritual Father disciplining us so we will live eternally!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_10" data-id="HB12_10">Our natural fathers disciplined us for a short time as they considered right, but God always disciplines us to help us share in his holy nature.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_11" data-id="HB12_11">During the time God is disciplining us, it  does not seem to be anything about which we can rejoice. Instead, it pains us. But later it causes those who have learned from it to live righteously, which produces peace in us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_12" data-id="HB12_12">So, instead of acting as though you were spiritually tired out, trust God's discipline to renew you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_13" data-id="HB12_13">Go straight forward following Christ so that believers who are weak in trusting Christ will gain strength from you and not leave God's way. Instead, they will be spiritually restored as an injured and useless limb is restored.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_14" data-id="HB12_14">Try to live peacefully with all people. Do your best to be holy, since no one will see the Lord if he is not holy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_15" data-id="HB12_15">Beware that none of you stops trusting in God, who has done kind things for us that we did not deserve. Be on guard lest any of you act in an evil way toward others, because that will grow like a root grows into a big plant, leading many believers to sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_16" data-id="HB12_16">Do not let anyone be immoral or disobey God like Esau. He exchanged the rights he had as a firstborn son for only one meal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_17" data-id="HB12_17">Esau later wanted to get back his birth rights and all that his father Isaac's blessing would give him. But Isaac refused to do what Esau requested. So Esau found no way to get back his birth rights and blessing, even though he sought it tearfully.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_18" data-id="HB12_18">In coming to God, you have not experienced things like what the Israelite people experienced at Mount Sinai. They approached a mountain that God commanded them not to touch because he himself had come down to that mountain. They approached a blazing fire, and it was gloomy and dark, with a violent storm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_19" data-id="HB12_19">They heard a trumpet sound, and they heard God speak a message. It was so powerful that they  pleaded for him not to speak to them like that again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_20" data-id="HB12_20">For God had commanded them, "If a person or even an animal touches this mountain, you must kill him." The people were terrified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_21" data-id="HB12_21">Truly, because Moses was terrified after seeing what happened on the mountain, he said, "I am trembling because I am very afraid!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_22" data-id="HB12_22">Instead, you have come to the presence of God who truly lives in heaven, to the "New Jerusalem." That is like what your ancestors did when they came to worship God on Mount Zion in Israel, upon which the earthly Jerusalem was built. You have come to where there are countless angels who are rejoicing as they have gathered together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_23" data-id="HB12_23">You have joined the assembly of all the believers who have privileges as firstborn sons, whose names God has written down in heaven. You have come to God, who will judge everyone. You have come to where the spirits of God's people are, people who lived righteously before they died, and whom God has now made perfect in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_24" data-id="HB12_24">You have come to Jesus, who arranged a new covenant between us and God by the blood that flowed when he died on the cross. Jesus' blood made it possible for God to forgive us, and his blood is better than was Abel's blood.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_25" data-id="HB12_25">Beware that you do not refuse to listen to God who is speaking to you. The Israelite people did not escape God punishing them when Moses warned them here on earth. So we shall surely not escape God punishing us if we reject him when he warns us from heaven!</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_26" data-id="HB12_26">The earth shook when he spoke at Mount Sinai. But now he has promised, "I will shake the earth again, one more time, and I will shake the heavens, too."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_27" data-id="HB12_27">The words "again, one more time" indicate that God will remove those things on earth that he will shake, everything that he has created. He will do this in order that the things in heaven that cannot shake may remain forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_28" data-id="HB12_28">So let us thank God that we are becoming members of a kingdom that nothing can shake. Let us worship God by gratefully thanking him and by being greatly in awe of his great power and love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB12_29" data-id="HB12_29">Remember that the God we worship is like a fire that burns up everything that is impure!</span>

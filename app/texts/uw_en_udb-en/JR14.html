<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_11" data-id="JR14_11">Then Yahweh said to me, "Do not pray for these people anymore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_12" data-id="JR14_12">When they fast, I will not pay any attention. When they bring to me their offerings of animals to be completely burned on the altar and their offerings of flour, I will not accept them. Instead, I will get rid of them by wars, by famines, and by diseases."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_13" data-id="JR14_13">Then I replied to him, "Yahweh my God, their prophets are telling the people that they will not experience wars or famines.

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_14" data-id="JR14_14">Yahweh replied to me, "Those prophets say that they are speaking what I tell them to say, but they are telling lies. I did not send them, so what they are saying is false. They say that they have received visions from me, and that they are telling things that I have revealed to them, but that is not true. They are saying foolish things that they have only thought of themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_15" data-id="JR14_15">So this is what I say about those prophets who are predicting what will happen, saying that I told them those things: They are saying that we Israelites will not die from wars or famines, but I did not send those prophets. And they themselves will die from wars or from famines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_16" data-id="JR14_16">And the people to whom they are predicting these things, they and their wives and their sons and their daughters, will also die from wars or from famines. Their corpses will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will not be anyone to bury them. I will punish them like they deserve to be punished.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_17" data-id="JR14_17">So, Jeremiah, tell this to them about yourself:</span>

</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v JR14_17" data-id="JR14_17">and they will not recover or heal from this severe wound.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JR14_19" data-id="JR14_19">Then I prayed this:</span>

</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v JR14_19" data-id="JR14_19">We hoped that we would have peace,</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_1" data-id="MK4_1">Another time Jesus began to teach people alongside the sea of Galilee. As he was teaching, a very large crowd gathered around him. He got into a boat and pushed out onto the water. Then he sat down in the boat so that he could speak to the crowd better. At the same time, the crowd was on the shore close to the water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_2" data-id="MK4_2">Then he taught them many parables. While he was teaching them, he told them this:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_3" data-id="MK4_3">"Listen to this: A man went out to his field to sow some seeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_4" data-id="MK4_4">As he was scattering them over the soil, some of the seeds fell on the path. Then some birds came and ate those seeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_5" data-id="MK4_5">Other seeds fell on ground where there was not much soil on top of the rock. Very soon the seeds sprouted because the sun warmed the moist soil quickly where it was not deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_6" data-id="MK4_6">But after the sun shone on those young plants, they became scorched. Then they withered because they did not have deep roots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_7" data-id="MK4_7">As he sowed, other seeds fell on ground that contained roots of thorny plants. The seeds grew, but the thorny plants also grew up and crowded out the good plants. So the plants produced no grain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_8" data-id="MK4_8">But as he sowed, other seeds fell on good soil. As a result, they sprouted, they grew well, and then they produced plenty of grain. Some plants bore thirty times as much as the seed that the man had planted. Some bore sixty times as much. Some bore one hundred times as much."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_9" data-id="MK4_9">Then Jesus said, "If you want to understand this, you should consider carefully what I have just said."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_10" data-id="MK4_10">Later, when only the twelve disciples and other close followers were with him, they asked him about the parables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_11" data-id="MK4_11">He said to them, "To you I will explain the message about how God reveals himself as king, but to the others I will speak in parables.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">When they see what I am doing, they will not learn.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">When they hear what I say, they will not understand.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">If they learned or understood,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">they would be sorry that they had sinned and decide to stop sinning,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">and God would forgive them."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_13" data-id="MK4_13">He also said to them, "Do you not understand this parable?  How then will you understand when I teach you other parables?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_14" data-id="MK4_14">In the parable that I told you, the man who sows seeds represents someone who teaches God's message to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_15" data-id="MK4_15">Some people are like the path where some of the seeds fell. When they hear God's message, Satan comes at once and causes them to forget what they have heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_16" data-id="MK4_16">Some people are like the ground where the soil was not very deep over the rock. When they hear God's message, they immediately accept it with joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_17" data-id="MK4_17">But, because the message does not grow deep, they believe it for only a short time. They are like the plants that did not have deep roots. When others treat them badly or cause them to suffer because they believed God's message, those people who are suffering soon stop believing God's message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_18" data-id="MK4_18">Some people are like the soil that had roots of thorny weeds in it. Although those people hear God's message,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_19" data-id="MK4_19">they desire to be rich, and they desire to own many other things. So they only worry about these things. The result is that they forget God's message and they do not do the things that God wants them to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_20" data-id="MK4_20">But some people are like the good soil. They hear God's message and they accept it and they believe it, they do the things that God wants them to do. They are like the good plants that produced thirty, sixty, or one hundred grains."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_21" data-id="MK4_21">He told them another parable: "People certainly do not light an oil lamp and then bring it in the house in order to put something over it to cover its light. Instead, they put it on a lampstand so that the light will shine.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_22" data-id="MK4_22">Similarly, things that were hidden—one day everyone will know them, and the things that have happened in secret—one day everyone will see them in full light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_23" data-id="MK4_23">If you want to understand this, you should consider carefully what you have just heard."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_24" data-id="MK4_24">Then he said to them, "Consider carefully what you hear me say to you, for God will let you understand to the same degree that you consider what I say. He will let you understand even more than that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_25" data-id="MK4_25">Those who consider what I say and understand it, God will enable them to understand more. But those who do not consider carefully what I say, they will forget even what they already know."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_26" data-id="MK4_26">Jesus also said, "When God begins to show himself as king, it is like a man who has scattered seed on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_27" data-id="MK4_27">Afterwards he slept each night and rose up each day without worrying about the seeds. During that time the seeds sprouted and grew in a way that he did not understand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_28" data-id="MK4_28">The ground produced the crop on its own.  First the stalks appeared. Then the heads appeared. Then the full kernels in the heads appeared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_29" data-id="MK4_29">As soon as the grain was ripe he sent people to harvest it because it was time to harvest the grain."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_30" data-id="MK4_30">Jesus told them another parable. He said, "When God begins to show himself as king, what is it like? What parable can I use to describe it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_31" data-id="MK4_31">It is like mustard seeds. You know what happens to mustard seeds when we plant them. Though mustard seeds are among the smallest of seeds, they become large plants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_32" data-id="MK4_32">After they are planted, they grow up and become larger than the other garden plants. They put out big branches so that birds are able to make nests in their shade."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_33" data-id="MK4_33">Jesus used many parables when he talked to the people about God message. If they were able to understand some, he kept telling them more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_34" data-id="MK4_34">He always used parables when he spoke to them. But he explained all the parables to his own disciples when he was alone with them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_35" data-id="MK4_35">On that same day, when the sun was setting, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let us cross over to the other side of the sea."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_36" data-id="MK4_36">Jesus was already in the boat, so they left the crowd and sailed into the sea. Other people also went with them in other boats.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_37" data-id="MK4_37">A strong wind came up and the waves started coming into the boat! The boat was soon nearly full of water!</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_38" data-id="MK4_38">Jesus was in the back part of the boat. He was sleeping with his head on a cushion. So they woke him up and said to him, "Teacher! Are you not concerned that we are about to perish?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_39" data-id="MK4_39">So Jesus got up and rebuked the wind. Then he said to the lake, "Be quiet! Be still! " The wind stopped blowing and then the lake became very calm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_40" data-id="MK4_40">He said to the disciples, "Why are you afraid? Do you not yet have faith?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_41" data-id="MK4_41">They were terrified. They said to one another, "Who is this man? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"</span>

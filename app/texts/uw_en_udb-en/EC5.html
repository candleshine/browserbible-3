<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_1" data-id="EC5_1">Be careful when you approach God in his house. Listen well to him. That is better than offering sacrifices to him and then not obeying him, which is foolish.</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Think carefully before you speak </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">and do not be too quick to promise God that you will do something.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Do not forget that God is in heaven and that he can do anything,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">while you, on the other hand, are here on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">So think carefully before you speak.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">If you are continually thinking and worrying about things,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">you will have bad dreams about them and not rest well.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">And the more you talk,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_3" data-id="EC5_3">the more likely it will be that you will say things that are foolish.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_4" data-id="EC5_4">When you solemnly promise God that you will do something, do not foolishly delay in doing it, because God is not pleased with foolish people. Do all the things that you promise God that you will do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_5" data-id="EC5_5">It is better to not promise anything than to promise to do something and then not do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_6" data-id="EC5_6">Do not let the things that you promise to do cause you to sin by not doing them. And if you promise God that you will do something but then do not do it, do not say to God's priest that it was a mistake for you to promise to do that. If you do that, God can destroy everything you have worked to accomplish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">Promising to do something and not doing it is like having a useless dream. Instead, honor God by doing what you promised him that you would do.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_8" data-id="EC5_8">Do not be surprised if you see poor people being oppressed. There are people able to stop others from oppressing them, but even these people are under the power of someone even higher.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_9" data-id="EC5_9">Even though people throughout the land own their fields, the king forces them to give him some of the crops that they harvest.</span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_10" data-id="EC5_10">will never think that they have enough.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_10" data-id="EC5_10">They will never be satisfied with the money that they have.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_10" data-id="EC5_10">That fact also makes no sense.</span>

<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_11" data-id="EC5_11">The more money that people have,</span>

<span class="v EC5_11" data-id="EC5_11">People who have a lot of money do not benefit from it,</span>
</div>

</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_12" data-id="EC5_12">because they worry about their money.</span>

<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_13" data-id="EC5_13">I have seen another terrible thing that happens here on the earth.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_13" data-id="EC5_13">People save up all their money and become rich,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_13" data-id="EC5_13">but they are miserable because they store up their money.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_14" data-id="EC5_14">If something happens that causes their money to be gone,</span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_14" data-id="EC5_14">then when they die,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_14" data-id="EC5_14">there is no money for their children.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">When we are born,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">we do not bring anything with us,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">and when we die,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">we take nothing with us</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_15" data-id="EC5_15">from all that we have earned by working hard.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">That also seems to make no sense.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">People bring nothing into the world when they are born,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">and when they leave this world they take nothing with them.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">They have worked hard,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_16" data-id="EC5_16">but they receive no lasting benefit.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_17" data-id="EC5_17">Furthermore, rich people are always miserable, sad,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_17" data-id="EC5_17">and depressed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_18" data-id="EC5_18">So the best thing for people to do here on the earth during the few years that God allows them to be alive is to eat, drink, and enjoy their work, because those are the things that he allows them to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_19" data-id="EC5_19">If people are rich and have a lot of possessions, and are able to enjoy the things that they have and to enjoy their work, those things are also gifts from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_20" data-id="EC5_20">Those people do not think much about everything that has happened during their lifetime, because God makes sure that they keep working at what they enjoy.</span>

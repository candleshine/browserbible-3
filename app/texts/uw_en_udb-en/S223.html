</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S223_8" data-id="S223_8">The first was Jeshbaal, from the Hachmon clan. He was the leader of the greatest soldiers. Once he fought against eight hundred enemies and killed them all with his spear.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_9" data-id="S223_9">The second of the greatest warriors was Eleazar son of Dodo, who was from the clan of Ahoh. One day he was with David when they defied the soldiers of Philistia who had gathered there for the battle. The other Israelite soldiers retreated,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_10" data-id="S223_10">but Eleazar stood there and fought the soldiers of Philistia until his arm became very tired, with the result that his hand cramped and he could not stop gripping his sword. Yahweh won a great victory on that day. And afterwards the other Israelite soldiers returned to where Eleazar was, and stripped off the armor from the men whom he had killed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_11" data-id="S223_11">The third of the greatest warriors was Shammah son of Agee from the clan of Harar. One time the Philistine soldiers gathered at the city of Lehi, where there was a field full of lentils that they wanted to steal. The other Israelite soldiers ran away from the Philistine troops,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_12" data-id="S223_12">but Shammah stood there in the field and did not let the Philistine soldiers steal the peas, and killed them. Yahweh won a great victory on that day.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_13" data-id="S223_13">At one time, when it was almost time to harvest the crops, three of those thirty men went down to the Cave of Adullam, where David was staying. A group of men from the Philistine army had set up their tents in the Valley of Rephaim near Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_14" data-id="S223_14">David and his soldiers were in the cave because it was safe there, and another group of Philistine soldiers was occupying Bethlehem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_15" data-id="S223_15">One day David very much wanted some water to drink, and said, "I wish that someone would bring me some water from the well near the gate at Bethlehem!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_16" data-id="S223_16">So his three greatest warriors forced through the camp of Philistine soldiers and drew some water from the well, and brought it to David. But he would not drink it. Instead, he poured it out on the ground to be an offering to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_17" data-id="S223_17">He said, "Yahweh, it would certainly not be right for me to drink this water! That would be like drinking the blood of these men who were willing to die for me!" So he refused to drink it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S223_17" data-id="S223_17">That was one of the things that those three great warriors did.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_18" data-id="S223_18">Abishai, Joab's younger brother, was the leader of David's greatest soldiers. One day he fought against three hundred men and killed them all with his spear. As a result, he also became famous.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_19" data-id="S223_19">He was the most famous of the greatest soldiers, and he became their leader, but even he was not one of the three greatest warriors.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_20" data-id="S223_20">Jehoiada's son Benaiah, from the city of Kabzeel, also did great deeds. He killed two of the best warriors from the Moab people group. Also, he went down into a pit on a day when snow was falling on the ground, and killed a lion there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_21" data-id="S223_21">He also killed a huge soldier from Egypt who carried a spear. Benaiah had only his club, but he attacked the giant with it. Then he snatched the spear from the man's hand and killed him with his own spear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_22" data-id="S223_22">Those are some of the things that Benaiah did. As a result, he became famous, like the three greatest warriors were.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_23" data-id="S223_23">He was more honored than the other greatest soldiers, but not as famous as the three greatest. David appointed him to be the commander of his bodyguards.</span>

<div class="c">11</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_1" data-id="C111_1">Follow my example, just like I follow the example of Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_2" data-id="C111_2">I praise you because you remember me in all you do, and you hold tight to all the important teachings that I have passed down to you and you have kept them just as I taught them to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_3" data-id="C111_3">I want you to understand that Christ has authority over every man, and that a man has authority over a woman, and that God has authority over Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_4" data-id="C111_4">So if any man covers his head when he prays or when he proclaims a message from God, he brings disgrace on himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_5" data-id="C111_5">But if a woman prays or proclaims a message God gave her, with her head uncovered, she brings disgrace on herself. For it is exactly the same as if she had shaved her head.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_6" data-id="C111_6">If a woman refuses to cover her head, then she should cut her hair short, like a man's. But you know that it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut short or to have her head shaved. So, instead, she should cover her head. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_7" data-id="C111_7">A man should not cover his head because God made him like himself, and the man reflects some of what God himself is like. But women reflect some of what men are like.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_8" data-id="C111_8">For God did not make man Adam from the woman Eve; instead, he made the woman Eve from the man Adam.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_9" data-id="C111_9">It was not the man whom God created for the help of the woman, but the woman for the man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_10" data-id="C111_10">This is why women should cover their heads, as a sign of the authority of the man over her, and because of the angels. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_11" data-id="C111_11">So as we live joined to the Lord, women need men to help them, and men need women to help them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_12" data-id="C111_12">This is because the woman was made from the man, and the man is born from the woman. They are dependent on one another. But all things come from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_13" data-id="C111_13">Judge this for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God without a cover on her head?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_14" data-id="C111_14">Nature itself teaches us that it is a disgrace for a man to have long hair,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_15" data-id="C111_15">but they also teach that long hair for a woman is a display of her beauty. Her hair is given to her by God to cover her beauty.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_16" data-id="C111_16">But if anyone in the church wishes to argue about this matter, we do not have any other custom than this, nor do any of the churches do anything different.   </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_17" data-id="C111_17">In these instructions, I cannot praise you for what you are doing about the Lord's supper. When you come together to eat, instead of encouraging and helping one another, you make the fellowship in the church much worse. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_18" data-id="C111_18">The first matter of concern is that when you come together, you come with different groups and factions. From what people have told me, this seems to be the truth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_19" data-id="C111_19">It appears that you have different groups among yourselves, some are approved and have places of honor, and others are not. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_20" data-id="C111_20">When you come together you are not eating the Lord's Supper.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_21" data-id="C111_21">When you eat, one person brings an entire meal and eats it as soon as he arrives; he does not wait for anyone else. Another person goes hungry while other people drink so much wine that they get drunk.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_22" data-id="C111_22">You act as though you did not have houses to eat and drink in! You treat the church with dishonor, and you despise the purpose for which you gather. You humiliate those who are poor. I can say nothing good about this. This is a disgrace. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_23" data-id="C111_23">For I have passed on to you what I received from the Lord, that on the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to his enemies, he took bread,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_24" data-id="C111_24">and after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you, do this and remember me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_25" data-id="C111_25">After the same manner, he took the cup, after they had eaten, and said, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this as often as you drink it, remember me." </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_26" data-id="C111_26">For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he  comes again.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_27" data-id="C111_27">All who come to this celebration of the Lord's Supper should come to give honor to God in the way it is shared. Those who eat the bread and drink the cup must do so in a manner that honors the Lord. Anyone who dishonors the bread and the cup will be guilty of a sin against the body and blood of the Lord.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_28" data-id="C111_28">Therefore we should all examine ourselves before we take the communion. We should only eat the bread and drink the cup after we have examined our lives, our sins, and God's mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_29" data-id="C111_29">Anyone who eats and drinks this Supper and does not consider that he is handling the Lord's body, eats and drinks the judgment of God on himself. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_30" data-id="C111_30">Many among you are physically ill, and several have even died  because of the way you have treated the Lord's Supper.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_31" data-id="C111_31">If we examine ourselves before we take the communion, God will not judge us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_32" data-id="C111_32">But when the Lord judges and punishes us, he disciplines us to correct us, so that he will not condemn us along with the world that has rebelled against God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_33" data-id="C111_33">My fellow believers, when you come together for the Lord's Supper, wait for one another. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">If one of you is hungry, eat at homeâ€”so that when you come together as the church, it will not be an occasion for God to discipline you.  </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v C111_34" data-id="C111_34">And when I come to you, I will give you instructions concerning the other matters you wrote me about.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_1" data-id="RV16_1">In the vision I heard someone in the very holy place speak in a loud voice to the angels who had the seven bowls. He said, "Go from here and pour out on the earth the wine in the seven bowls. This will make the people suffer because God is angry with them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_2" data-id="RV16_2">So the first angel went and poured out on the earth the wine that was in his bowl. As a result, horrible and painful sores broke out on the people who had allowed the beast's servants to write the beast's name on them, those who had worshiped the beast's image.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_3" data-id="RV16_3">Then the second angel poured out on the ocean the wine that was in his bowl. As a result, the water in the ocean stank like the blood of a corpse,  and every creature in the ocean died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_4" data-id="RV16_4">Then the third angel poured out on the rivers and water springs the wine that was in his bowl. As a result, the water in the rivers and springs turned into blood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_5" data-id="RV16_5">I heard the angel who has power over the waters say to God, "O God, you exist and have always existed. You are the holy one. You judge people justly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_6" data-id="RV16_6">The people who rebelled against you murdered your holy people and the prophets. So you are just in punishing them by giving them blood to drink. This is what they deserve."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_7" data-id="RV16_7">Then I heard someone at the altar answer, "Yes, Lord God, you who are almighty, you punish people rightly and justly."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_8" data-id="RV16_8">Then the fourth angel poured out on the sun the wine that was in his bowl. He enabled the sun to scorch people with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_9" data-id="RV16_9">So the people were severely burned, and they said evil things about God because he had the power to make them suffer in these ways. But they still refused to turn away from their evil behavior and refused to praise him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_10" data-id="RV16_10">When the fifth angel poured out on the throne of the beast the wine that was in his bowl, it became dark where the beast ruled. So the beast and the people whom the beast ruled were biting their tongues because they were suffering intense pain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_11" data-id="RV16_11">They insulted God who rules in heaven because their sores were so painful. But they refused to stop doing the evil things that they were doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_12" data-id="RV16_12">Then the sixth angel poured out on the Euphrates River the wine that was in his bowl. The water in the river dried up so that the rulers from the eastern countries could cross it with their armies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_13" data-id="RV16_13">Then I saw evil spirits that looked like frogs. One came out of the mouth of the dragon, one from the mouth of the beast, and one from the mouth of the false prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_14" data-id="RV16_14">Those spirits were demons who were able to perform miracles. They went out to the rulers of the whole world in order to gather their armies. This is so that they will fight on the important day when Almighty God punishes his enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_15" data-id="RV16_15">(I heard the Lord Jesus say, "You must listen carefully to me: I am coming unexpectedly, like a thief. So I will be happy with those who stay alert and keep on living in the right way so that they will not be ashamed. They will be just like a person who keeps his clothes on so that he will not be ashamed in front of other people.")</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_16" data-id="RV16_16">The evil spirits will gather the rulers at a place named in the Hebrew language Armageddon.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_17" data-id="RV16_17">Then the seventh angel poured out into the air the wine that was in his bowl. As a result, someone said with a loud voice from the throne in the very holy place, "The time for God to punish rebellious people is finished."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_18" data-id="RV16_18">When the angel emptied his bowl, lightning flashed, there were rumblings and thunder, and the earth shook. It shook more violently than it had ever shaken since people first lived on earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_19" data-id="RV16_19">As a result, the very large city split into three parts. God also destroyed the cities in the other nations. God did not forget that the people of Babylon had sinned very much. So he made them drink a cup of the wine that made them suffer because he was angry with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_20" data-id="RV16_20">Also as a result of the earthquake, every island disappeared, and the mountains became flat land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV16_21" data-id="RV16_21">Huge hailstones, each weighing about forty kilograms, fell from the sky onto the people. Then people insulted God because he had punished them in this terrible way, and because the hailstones were very large.</span>

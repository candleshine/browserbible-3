<div class="mt1">Peter</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_1" data-id="P11_1">I, Peter, whom Jesus Christ made an apostle, am writing this letter to you who believe in him, you whom God has chosen to belong to himself. I am writing to you who live in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, far away from your true home in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_2" data-id="P11_2">God our Father chose you as he himself decided previously, and his Spirit has set you apart in order that you may obey Jesus Christ, and in order that his blood may make you acceptable to God. May God act very kindly to you, and may he give you much peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_3" data-id="P11_3">Praise God, who is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! It is because he is kind to us that he has made us live again. Because he has caused Jesus Christ to become alive again after he died, we know that he will do for us what he has promised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_4" data-id="P11_4">He has enabled us to expect to receive things that he has kept for us in heaven, things that will last forever.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_5" data-id="P11_5">God, by his mighty power, is guarding you as you trust in Jesus. He is guarding you so that he may, at the end of the time in which we now live, completely rescue you from Satan's power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_6" data-id="P11_6">You rejoice because of what will happen then, but now you are grieving for a short time while you suffer many different hardships. God is allowing you to be tested, as precious metals are tested to see if they are pure. These trials that you are experiencing are necessary. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_7" data-id="P11_7">These hardships happen in order to prove that you really do trust in Jesus. This means more to God than all the gold in the world, which fire can destroy. Because you trust in Jesus, God will honor you very highly when Jesus Christ comes again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_8" data-id="P11_8">You love Jesus, although you have not seen him. Although you do not see him now, you rejoice very much;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_9" data-id="P11_9">because you trust in him, God is saving you  from the guilt of your sins.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_10" data-id="P11_10">Long ago prophets spoke messages that God had shown them about how he would one day save you. They investigated very carefully these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_11" data-id="P11_11">They wanted to know whom the Spirit of Christ that was in them was referring to. They also wanted to know what time he was talking about. This was because the Spirit was telling them beforehand that the Christ would suffer and die, and that glorious things would happen to him afterwards.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_12" data-id="P11_12">God told them that it was not for their own sake that he was revealing these things to them, but that it was for your sake. They proclaimed them to you because the Holy Spirit whom God sent from heaven enabled them to do that. And even angels would like to know more about these truths about how God saves us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_13" data-id="P11_13">Therefore, prepare your minds to obey God. What I mean is that you should discipline your minds. Be confident that you will receive the good things that God will kindly do for you when Jesus Christ returns from heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_14" data-id="P11_14">And because you should obey your heavenly Father, just as children ought to obey their fathers here on earth, do not do the evil deeds that you previously wished to do, when you did not know the truth about God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_15" data-id="P11_15">Instead, just like God, the one who chose you to belong to him, is holy, you also must be holy in everything that you do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_16" data-id="P11_16">Be holy, because it is written in the Scriptures that God said, "You must be holy because I am holy."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_17" data-id="P11_17">God is the one who judges what each one does, and he does this very fairly. Since you call him 'Father,' behave in a right way while you are living here on earth. You are like people whom others have driven from their homes, because you are living away from heaven, your true home.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_18" data-id="P11_18">Live reverently because you know that it was not with things like gold and silver—things that will not last forever—that God bought you, so you could stop behaving foolishly, as you learned to do from your ancestors.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_19" data-id="P11_19">Instead, it was with the precious blood of Christ that flowed from his body when he died that God bought you. Christ was a like the lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed: perfect, without any blemishes or spots.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_20" data-id="P11_20">God chose him to do this before he created the world. But it was not until now, when the world will soon end, that God revealed him to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_21" data-id="P11_21">Because of what Christ has done, you are trusting in God, who caused him to become alive again after he died, and who greatly honored him. As a result, God is the one in whom you are trusting and expecting that he will do great things for you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_22" data-id="P11_22">Because you have obeyed the truth about God and have allowed him to make you pure and to love our fellow believers, continue to love each other earnestly and sincerely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_23" data-id="P11_23">I ask you to do this, because you now are living a new life. It was not by means of something that will perish that you received this new life. Instead, it was by means of something that will last forever; that is, by believing in what God has said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_24" data-id="P11_24">We know that this is true because, as the prophet Isaiah wrote,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P11_24" data-id="P11_24">"All people will perish like grass perishes. And all the greatness that people have will not last forever,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P11_24" data-id="P11_24">like the flowers in the grass do not last long.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v P11_24" data-id="P11_24">The grass withers and the flowers die,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v P11_25" data-id="P11_25">but God's message endures forever."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
 This message that endures is the message about Christ that we proclaimed to you.</div>

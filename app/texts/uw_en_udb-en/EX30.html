<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX30_2" data-id="EX30_2">It is to be square, one half meter on each side. It is to be about 0.9 meter high.

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX30_3" data-id="EX30_3">They must cover the top and the four sides, including the projections, with pure gold. Put a gold border around the altar near the top.</span>

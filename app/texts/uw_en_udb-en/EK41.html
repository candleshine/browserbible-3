<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_1" data-id="EK41_1">Then in the vision the man brought me to into the holy place in the temple and measured the doorposts on either side of the entrance; they were each about 3.2 meters wide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_2" data-id="EK41_2">The entrance was about 5.4 meters wide, and the walls of each side of it were about 2.7 meters long. He also measured the holy place; it was about twenty-two meters long and about about eleven meters wide.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_5" data-id="EK41_5">Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was about 3.2 meters thick. There was a row of rooms along the outside wall of the temple. Each of those rooms was about two meters wide.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_6" data-id="EK41_6">There were three storys of rooms, with thirty rooms on each story. There were ledges all around the wall of the temple that were supports for the side rooms above. There were no extra supports built into the sanctuary wall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_7" data-id="EK41_7">Each of the side rooms was wider than the one below it. The most narrow rooms were built first, at the bottom. Then a wider set of rooms was built over it, and the widest set was at the top. A set of stairs was built from the lowest level through the middle level to the highest level.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_8" data-id="EK41_8">I saw that there was a terrace around the temple. The terrace was the foundation for those side rooms; it was about 3.2 meters high.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_9" data-id="EK41_9">The outer wall of those side rooms was about 2.7 meters thick. All around the sanctuary there was an open area between those side rooms</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_12" data-id="EK41_12">There was a large building on the west side of the temple area. It was about thirty-eight meters wide, and it had a wall about 2.7 meters thick and about forty-nine meters long.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v EK41_15" data-id="EK41_15">The outer walls of the holy place, of the very holy place, and the portico,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_16" data-id="EK41_16">the inner walls above and below the narrow windows, and the galleries on all the storysâ€”all these things were  covered with thin panels of wood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_17" data-id="EK41_17">All the walls inside the temple were decorated with carvings of winged creatures and palm trees; between each figure of a winged creature was a carving of a palm tree. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18-19">18-19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_18-19" data-id="EK41_18-19">Each winged creature had two faces. One face was the face of a human, and one was the face of a lion. Those figures were carved on the walls all around the inside of the temple, and each face looked at the carving of a palm tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK41_20" data-id="EK41_20">They covered all the walls, from the floor to the wall above the entryway.</span>

<div class="c">13</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_1" data-id="R213_1">When Jeroboam had been ruling Israel for almost eighteen years, Abijah became the king of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_2" data-id="R213_2">He ruled in Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Micaiah, the daughter of Uriel from the city of Gibeah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v R213_2" data-id="R213_2">There was a war between the armies of Abijah and Jeroboam.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_3" data-id="R213_3">Abijah went into the battle, taking 400,000 of his capable soldiers, and Jeroboam prepared to fight them, taking 800,000 of his capable troops.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_4" data-id="R213_4">Abijah stood on the top of Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill country that belonged to the tribe of Ephraim, and he shouted, "Jeroboam and all you other people of Israel, listen to me!</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_5" data-id="R213_5">You certainly know that Yahweh, whom we Israelites are to worship, made a covenant with David by which he promised that his descendants would always rule over Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_6" data-id="R213_6">But Jeroboam, who was only an official of David's son King Solomon, rebelled against his king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_7" data-id="R213_7">And when Solomon's son Rehoboam became king and was still young and inexperienced, a group of worthless scoundrels gathered around you and rebelled against him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_8" data-id="R213_8">And now you are planning to fight against the kingdom that Yahweh established to be governed by David's descendants. It is true that you have a huge army, and you and your soldiers have brought with you the golden statues of calves that Jeroboam's workers made to be your gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_9" data-id="R213_9">But you drove out the priests that Yahweh appointed, men who are descendants of Aaron the first high priest. You also drove out the descendants of Levi, and you appointed the priests that you wanted, like the people of other countries do. One comes to consecrate himself to Yahweh by bringing to be a priest a young bull and seven rams to be sacrified, that same priest would be the one who just offered sacrifices to gods that were no gods at all.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_10" data-id="R213_10">As for us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not abandoned him. Our priests who serve Yahweh are descendants of Aaron, and the descendants of Levi assist them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_11" data-id="R213_11">Every morning and every evening they present to Yahweh offerings to be completely burned on the altar, and they burn fragrant incense. Each week they place on the sacred table the bread to display before Yahweh, and each morning they light the lamps that are on the gold lampstand. We are obeying what Yahweh our God requires us to do. But you have abandoned him; you no longer worship him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_12" data-id="R213_12">Yahweh is with us; he is our leader. The priests whom he has appointed will blow their trumpets to signal that we are ready to fight a battle against you. You Israelite men, do not fight against Yahweh, the God to whom your ancestors belonged, because you will not be successful against him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_13" data-id="R213_13">While he was speaking, Jeroboam sent some of his troops around the army of Judah. So while the soldiers who were with Jeroboam were in front of the army of Judah, the other soldiers of Israel were behind the army of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_14" data-id="R213_14">When the soldiers of Judah turned and saw that they were going to be attacked from the front and from the rear, they cried out to Yahweh. The priests blew their trumpets,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_15" data-id="R213_15">and the men of Judah shouted a loud battle cry. Then Yahweh enabled Abijah and the army of Judah to defeat Jeroboam and the army of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_16" data-id="R213_16">The soldiers of Israel fled from the soldiers of Judah, and God enabled the army of Judah to defeat them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_17" data-id="R213_17">Abijah and his troops struck the capable soldiers of Israel and killed 500,000 of them, the best soldiers there were in Israel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_18" data-id="R213_18">So the soldiers of Israel were defeated, and the soldiers of Judah won the battle because they trusted in Yahweh, the God to whom their ancestors belonged.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_19" data-id="R213_19">Abijah's army pursued the army of Jeroboam, and they captured from the people of Israel the cities of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the surrounding villages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_20" data-id="R213_20">During the remaining time that Abijah ruled, Jeroboam did not become powerful again. Then Yahweh caused him to become very ill, and he died.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_21" data-id="R213_21">But Abijah became more powerful. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R213_22" data-id="R213_22">An account of the other things that Abijah did while he was the was king, including what he said and what he did, is in the scroll written by the prophet Iddo.</span>

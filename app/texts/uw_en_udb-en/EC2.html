<div class="section chapter EC EC2 uw_en_udb-en en" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="EC2" data-nextid="EC3" data-previd="EC1">
<div class="c">2</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_1" data-id="EC2_1">Then I said to myself, "Well, I will try to do everything that I enjoy. I will find out whether doing what I enjoy can truly enable me to be happy." But I found out that doing that was also useless.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_2" data-id="EC2_2">So I said to myself, "It is foolish to laugh all the time, and continually doing what makes me happy does not  bring any lasting benefit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_3" data-id="EC2_3">So, after thinking a lot about it, I decided to cheer myself up by drinking a lot of wine. While I was still trying to be wise, I acted stupidly. I tried to learn what people can do to be happy during the short time that they are alive on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_4" data-id="EC2_4">I did great things. I caused houses to be built for myself and vineyards to be planted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_5" data-id="EC2_5">I made gardens and parks. Then I planted the gardens with many kinds of fruit trees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_6" data-id="EC2_6">I built pools of water to store water to irrigate the fruit trees.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_7" data-id="EC2_7">I bought male and female slaves. Babies who later became my slaves were born in my palace. I also owned more livestock than any of the previous kings in Jerusalem had owned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_8" data-id="EC2_8">I also accumulated large amounts of silver and gold that were acquired from the treasures of kings and rulers of provinces. I owned men and women who sang for me, and I had many wives and concubines, whom men all over the world would enjoy possessing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_9" data-id="EC2_9">So I gained more power and wealth than any king who had ruled before me in Jerusalem, and I allowed my wisdom to continue to guide me.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">I got everything that I saw and wanted.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">I did everything that I thought would enable me to be happy.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_10" data-id="EC2_10">All the things that I enjoyed were like a reward for all my hard work.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">But then I thought about all the hard work that I had done to obtain all those things.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">I saw that none of my work brought me any lasting benefit.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_11" data-id="EC2_11">It was all like trying to control the wind.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">Then I started to think about being wise, and also about being foolish.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_12" data-id="EC2_12">I said to myself, "I certainly do not think that anybody  will be able to do anything better than I can."</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">And I thought, "Surely it is better to be wise than to be foolish,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_13" data-id="EC2_13">like light is better than darkness,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">because wise people walk in the daylight and can see where they are going,</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">but foolish people walk in the darkness and cannot see where they are going."</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_14" data-id="EC2_14">But I also realized that both wise people and foolish people eventually die.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">So I said to myself,</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">"I am very wise, but I will die at the end of my life like foolish people do.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">So how has it benefited me to be very wise?</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC2_15" data-id="EC2_15">I do not understand why people consider that it is valuable to be wise.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">Wise people and foolish people all die.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC2_16" data-id="EC2_16">And after we die, we will all eventually be forgotten."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_17" data-id="EC2_17">So I hated being alive, because all the work that we do here on the earth distressed me. It all seemed to be useless, like trying to control the wind.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_18" data-id="EC2_18">I also began to hate all the hard work that I had done here on the earth, because when I die, everything that I have acquired will belong to the one who inherits it after me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_19" data-id="EC2_19">And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? But even if he is foolish, he will acquire all the things that I worked very hard and wisely to get.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_20" data-id="EC2_20">I thought about all the hard work that I had done in this world. It seemed useless, and I became depressed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_21" data-id="EC2_21">Some people work wisely and skillfully, using the things that they have learned. But when they die, they leave everything, and someone who has not worked for those things acquires them. That fact also seemed to be senseless and caused me to be discouraged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_22" data-id="EC2_22">So it is useless for people to work for all they do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_23" data-id="EC2_23">Every day the work that they do causes them to experience pain and to be worried. And during the night their minds are not able to rest. That also shows how temporary everything is.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_24" data-id="EC2_24">So I decided that the best thing that we can do is to enjoy what we eat and drink, and also to enjoy our work. And I realized that those things are what God intends for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_25" data-id="EC2_25">There is absolutely no one who is able to enjoy those things if God does not give those things to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC2_26" data-id="EC2_26">God enables those who please him to be wise, to know many things, and to enjoy many things. But if sinful people work hard and become rich, God can take their money away from them and give it to those who please him. However, the reason for that is also something that is difficult for me to understand. It seems useless that they worked so hard; it is like trying to control the wind.</span>

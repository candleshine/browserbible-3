<div class="c">8</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_1" data-id="RM8_1">So God will not condemn and punish those who are joined to Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_2" data-id="RM8_2">God's Spirit causes us to live in a new way because we are joined to Christ Jesus. In this way, I no longer have to sin when I think about sinning, and I will no more be separated from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_3" data-id="RM8_3">We tried to obey God's law in order to live with God, but it was useless to think that we couldâ€”we could not stop sinning. So God helped us instead: he sent his own Son into the world in order that his Son might atone for our sin. His Son came having a body that was like the body of us who sin. His Son came to offer himself as a sacrifice for our sin. When he did this, he also showed that our sins are truly wicked, and that anyone who sins deserves to be punished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_4" data-id="RM8_4">So we can now fulfill all that God required in his law. We do this, not by our acting the way our old evil nature desires, but instead by living as God's Spirit desires us to live.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_5" data-id="RM8_5">People who live by what their evil nature think about pay attention to those things. But people who live by what God's Spirit wants think about those things instead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_6" data-id="RM8_6">Those who think about and are concerned about what their evil nature desires will not live forever. But those who want what God's Spirit desires will live forever and have peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_7" data-id="RM8_7">Let me explain this. To the extent that people want what their evil nature desires, they are acting contrary to God. They do not obey his law. In fact, they are not even able to obey his law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_8" data-id="RM8_8">The people who do what their evil nature tells them cannot please God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_9" data-id="RM8_9">But we do not have to let our old evil nature control us. Instead, we can let God's Spirit control us, because he lives within us. If the Spirit who comes from Christ does not live in people, they do not belong to Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_10" data-id="RM8_10">But since Christ is living in you by his Spirit, God views your bodies as dead, so you no longer have to sin. And he views your spirits as alive, because he has put you right with himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_11" data-id="RM8_11">God caused Jesus to live again after he died. And because his Spirit lives in you, God will also make your bodies, which now are sure to die, live again. He caused Christ to live again after he died, and he will make you live again by causing his Spirit to do it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_12" data-id="RM8_12">Therefore, my fellow believers, we must live as the Spirit directs us. What we do not have to do is live as our old evil nature wants us to.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_13" data-id="RM8_13">If you do what your old evil nature wants, you will surely not live forever with God. But if you allow the Spirit to stop you doing those things, then you will live forever.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_14" data-id="RM8_14">We who obey the Spirit of God are God's children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_15" data-id="RM8_15">This is because you have received from God a Spirit who does not make you fear God again. You are not like slaves who fear their masters. On the contrary, this Spirit has made us God's children. The Spirit now enables us to cry out to God, "You are my Father!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_16" data-id="RM8_16">The Spirit himself confirms what our spirits say, that we are God's children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_17" data-id="RM8_17">Because we are God's children, we also will one day receive what God has promised us. And we will also receive what God has promised us and Christ together. But we must suffer for doing good as Christ did, in order that God may honor us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_18" data-id="RM8_18">I think that what we suffer during the present time is not worth paying attention to, because the future splendor that God will reveal to us will be so great.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_19" data-id="RM8_19">The things that God has created are very eagerly waiting for the time when he will reveal who his true children are.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_20" data-id="RM8_20">God caused the things that he created to be unable to achieve what he had intended. That was not because they wanted to fail. On the contrary, God made them that way because he was certain</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_21" data-id="RM8_21">that the things he created will one day no longer die, decay, and fall apart. He will free them from that, in order that he can do the same wonderful things for them that he will do for his children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_22" data-id="RM8_22">We know that until now it is as though all things that God created have been groaning together, and they want  him to do those same wonderful things for them. But now it is just like a woman who is having the pains that come before she gives birth to a child.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_23" data-id="RM8_23">Not only do those things groan, but we ourselves also groan inwardly. We who have God's Spirit, who is like a partial gift we have received as we wait for everything that God will give us, we groan inwardly. We groan while we wait eagerly for the time when we will receive our full rights as God's adopted children. That will include his freeing our bodies from the things that hinder us on earth. He will do this by giving us new bodies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_24" data-id="RM8_24">For God saved us because we had confidence in him. If we had now the things for which we have been waiting, we would not need to wait for them any longer. After all, if you possess something that you have been expecting to get, you certainly do not need to wait for it any longer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_25" data-id="RM8_25">But because we keep waiting expectantly to receive what we do not yet have, we wait for it eagerly and patiently.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_26" data-id="RM8_26">Similarly, God's Spirit helps us when we are weak. We do not know what is proper for us to pray. But God's Spirit knows; as he prays for us, he groans in a way that cannot be expressed in words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_27" data-id="RM8_27">God, who examines our inner nature and mind, understands what his Spirit desires. His Spirit prays for us who belong to God exactly as God wants him to pray.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_28" data-id="RM8_28">And we know that for those who love God, he works out all things that happen to them in a way that does us good. He does this for those whom he has chosen, because that was what he planned to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_29" data-id="RM8_29">God knew previously that we would believe in him.  We are those who God also decided previously would have a character like his Son's character. The result is that Christ is God's firstborn Son, and those who are God's children are the many younger brothers of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_30" data-id="RM8_30">And us who God decided previously that we would be like his Son he also summoned. And us whom he summoned, he also put right with himself. And to us whom he has put right with himself, he also will surely honor us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_31" data-id="RM8_31">So I will tell you what we must learn from all these things that God does for us. Because God is acting on our behalf, no one can win against us!</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_32" data-id="RM8_32">God did not spare even his very own Son. Instead, he turned him over to others to cruelly kill him in order that all we who believe in him may benefit from his dying for us. Because God did that, he will also certainly give us freely everything that we need to live for him, in addition to giving us Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_33" data-id="RM8_33">No one can accuse us before God of doing wrong, for he has chosen us to belong to him. He is the one who has put us right with himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_34" data-id="RM8_34">Who is the one who will condemn? Christ is the one who died for usâ€”and more than that, he also was raised from the deadâ€”and he is ruling with God in the place of honor, and he is the one who is pleading for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_35" data-id="RM8_35">Absolutely no one and nothing can cause Christ to stop loving us! That could not happen, even if someone afflicts us, or even someone harms us, or even if we have nothing to eat, or even if we do not have enough clothes, or even if we live in a dangerous situation, or even if someone will kill us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_36" data-id="RM8_36">Such things may happen to us, just as it is written that David said to God, "Because we are your people, others repeatedly attempt to kill us. They consider that we are only people to be killed, like a butcher considers that sheep are only animals to be slaughtered."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_37" data-id="RM8_37">But even though all these bad things happen to us, we win completely over these things because Christ, who loves us, helps us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_38" data-id="RM8_38">I am completely convinced that neither being dead, nor what happens to us while we live, nor angels, nor demons, nor present events, nor future events, nor powerful beings, </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM8_39" data-id="RM8_39">nor powerful beings in the sky or below it, nor anything else that God has created can cause God to stop loving us. God showed us that he loves us by sending Jesus Christ our Lord to die for us.</span>

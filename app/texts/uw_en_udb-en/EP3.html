<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_1" data-id="EP3_1">God has done all this for you non-Jews for which, I, Paul, am here in prison because of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_2" data-id="EP3_2">I assume that you know that God has honored me by giving me a certain task to do for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_3" data-id="EP3_3">He gave me this task because of the secret truth about which I wrote to you briefly;</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_4" data-id="EP3_4">when you read what I have already written briefly about that,  you will be able to understand that I clearly understand the truth about Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_5" data-id="EP3_5">Formerly, God did not fully reveal the good news that was to come to anyone. It was something that no one understood, but now his Spirit has revealed the good news to his apostles and  prophets whom the Spirit called to serve God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_6" data-id="EP3_6">This hidden truth is that the non-Jews now share together with Jews the spiritual riches of God, and belong to the same group of God's people, and will share all the things God has promised them, because they are joined to Christ Jesusâ€”this is the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_7" data-id="EP3_7">I am now God's servant to spread the good news, a work I did not deserve to do, but which God gave me working in me with his power.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_8" data-id="EP3_8">Although I am the least worthy of all God's people, God has enabled me by his kindness and mercy to proclaim to non-Jews the good news about what Christ has done for us, which is so much no one can describe it all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_9" data-id="EP3_9">My mission is to explain to everyone what God's plan is, something that God has kept hidden from long ago, from the time when he created everything. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_10" data-id="EP3_10">What God has wisely planned, he has even shown to powerful angels in heaven through his people who trust in Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_11" data-id="EP3_11">That is what God had always planned for eternity, and it is what he accomplished through the work of Christ Jesus our Lord. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_12" data-id="EP3_12">So now when we pray, we can come to God confidently and without being afraid, because we trust in Jesus, who has fulfilled God's plan. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_13" data-id="EP3_13">So I ask that you do not be discouraged because of my suffering many things for you here in prison, which should help you grow toward maturity.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_14" data-id="EP3_14">Because God has done all this for you, I kneel and pray to God our Father. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_15" data-id="EP3_15">He is the one who is like a father of all the believers who are now in heaven and those who are still on the earth, and he is the Creator of all beings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_16" data-id="EP3_16">I pray because of his great power that God will give you power and will strengthen you by his Spirit who lives in your spirits. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_17" data-id="EP3_17">I pray that Christ may live in your hearts because you trust in him, and that you will be like a firmly rooted tree and a building founded upon stone,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_18" data-id="EP3_18">so that you may be fully able to understand, along with the all those set apart for God, how wide and long and high and deep is the love Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_19" data-id="EP3_19">For this love is so great that we cannot understand it, but because of this love, I pray that God may fill you all with himself.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_20" data-id="EP3_20">God is able to do much greater things than we usually ask him to do, or even that we might think that he can do, because of his power that is working within us. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EP3_21" data-id="EP3_21">God must be honored beyond everything by all the believers assembled to worship him and by Christ Jesus himself. May all believers from all generations of history praise him forever and ever! So let it be done.</span>

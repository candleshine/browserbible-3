<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_1" data-id="EK40_1">Almost twenty-five years after the Babylonians had taken us Israelites to their land, on the tenth day of the first month of that year, almost fourteen years after Jerusalem had been destroyed, Yahweh grabbed hold of me with his power, and he took me in a vision to Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_2" data-id="EK40_2">He set me on a very high mountain. On the south side of that mountain there were some buildings that looked like part of a city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_3" data-id="EK40_3">When he took me there, I saw a man who looked as if he had been made of bronze. He was standing inside the city gate, and he was holding a linen cord and a measuring stick in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_4" data-id="EK40_4">He said to me, "Son of man, look carefully at everything that I am going to show you, and pay attention to everything that I say and everything that I wll show you, because that is why God brought you here. And then later you must tell the Israelite people everything that you have seen here."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_5" data-id="EK40_5">In the vision I saw that there was a wall that completely surrounded the temple area. The measuring stick in the man's hand was about 3.2 meters long. He measured the wall; it was about 3.2 meters thick and about 3.2 meters high. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_6" data-id="EK40_6">Then he went to the gate in the temple wall on the temple's east side. He climbed the steps and measured the gateway that faced outward; it was about 3.2 meters deep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_7" data-id="EK40_7">Next, there were alcoves for the temple guards, each being about 3.2 meters long and deep. The distance of the wall between each alcove was about 2.7 meters. The gateway that faced inward, which led to the temple portico, was also about 3.2 meters deep.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_8" data-id="EK40_8">Then he measured the portico that was after the gate; it was about 3.2 meters  long.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_9" data-id="EK40_9">He also measured the depth, which was about 3.2 meters. The doorposts on either side were about one meter thick. This was the portico attached to the temple gate on the gate's inner side, facing the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_10" data-id="EK40_10">Inside the east gate there were three alcoves for guards on each side of the gate. They all had the same length and depth. And the distance of wall between them was the same.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_11" data-id="EK40_11">Then he measured the opening of the gate; it was about 5.4 meters wide, and the entrance from the gate was about seven meters long.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_12" data-id="EK40_12">Running along in front of the alcoves was a low wall about about one half meter high. Each of the alcoves was about 3.2 meters long on all sides.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_13" data-id="EK40_13">Then the man measured the gateway's width from the roof of the alcove on one side, to the roof of the alcove on the other side. The distance was about 13.5 meters, from one alcove's entrance to that of the other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_14" data-id="EK40_14">Then the man measured along the wall that separated the alcoves from each other; it was thirty-two meters long. He measured them as far as the gate's portico.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_15" data-id="EK40_15">The distance from the entrance of the gate to the far end of its portico was about twenty-seven meters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_16" data-id="EK40_16">There were narrow windows in the walls of all the alcoves, and also in the inner walls between the alcoves. The portico also had these same windows on its inner side. The wall that ran between the alcoves was decorated with carvings of palm trees.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_17" data-id="EK40_17">Then the man brought me to the temple's outer courtyard. There I saw some rooms, and a stone pavement in the courtyard. There were thirty rooms facing the courtyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_18" data-id="EK40_18">The stone pavement was all around the courtyard, and it extended out from the walls into the courtyard for the same distance as the gate entrances. That was the lower pavement.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_19" data-id="EK40_19">Then the man measured the distance across the outer courtyard of the temple, between the outer gate and inner courtyard; it was about fifty-four meters on the east side, and the same distance on the north side of the courtyard.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_20" data-id="EK40_20">Then he measured how long and how wide was the gateway on the north side, which was an entrance into the outer courtyard of the temple complex.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_22" data-id="EK40_22">It had the same windows, portico, guard alcoves, and palm tree decorations as the east gate had. Like the east gate, there were seven steps leading up to it and its portico.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_23" data-id="EK40_23">Across the outer courtyard from the north gate was a gate leading to the inner courtyard, just as there was on the east side.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_24" data-id="EK40_24">Then he brought me through the south gateway into the inner courtyard, and he measured the entrance. It measured the same as the other gateways. Its alcoves, its walls between the alcoves, and its entry room measured the same as the ones on the other sides.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK40_25" data-id="EK40_25">The gateway and its portico had narrow windows along the walls, as on the other sides. The gateway and its portico measured about twenty-five meters long and about 13.5 meters wide.</span>

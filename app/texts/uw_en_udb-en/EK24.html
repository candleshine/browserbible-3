<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_18" data-id="EK24_18">So one morning I talked to the people as usual, and that evening my wife suddenly died. The next morning I did what Yahweh had told me to do.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_19" data-id="EK24_19">Then the people asked me, "What do the things that you are doing signify to us?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_20" data-id="EK24_20">I answered them, "This is what Yahweh told me:</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_25" data-id="EK24_25">Then Yahweh said to me,"Son of man, soon I will destroy their sacred temple, which they rejoice about and which they respect and delight to look at, and I will get rid of their sons and daughters also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EK24_26" data-id="EK24_26">On that day, someone will escape from Jerusalem and come and tell you what has happened there.</span>

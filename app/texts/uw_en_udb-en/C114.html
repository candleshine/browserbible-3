<div class="c">14</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_1" data-id="C114_1">You must ask God earnestly to enable you to love others. Ask him also to enable you to strengthen your fellow believers with gifts that the Spirit will give you; ask him especially to make you able to proclaim his messages that he gives you to say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_2" data-id="C114_2">When a person speaks in a language given by the Spirit, he is not speaking to people, because no one can understand him, but he is speaking to God. He is saying things to him as the Spirit leads him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_3" data-id="C114_3">On the other hand, the prophet who proclaims the messages from God speaks directly to people. He does this in order to help them by making them stronger, to help them be unshakable, and to give them comfort so they can be happy even in hardship.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_4" data-id="C114_4">A person who speaks  in a language given by the Spirit builds himself up and gives himself help, but a person who proclaims the messages of God builds up everyone and helps everyone in the church to be stronger in their faith.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_5" data-id="C114_5">Now I wish that all of you spoke in such languages, but it would be far better for the entire church if more and more of you had the gift of speaking God's messages. Anyone who speaks messages from God is helping to strengthen his fellow believers. For this reason, he is doing work that is more important than those who proclaim messages in various other languages—unless someone is able to interpret those messages.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_6" data-id="C114_6">If I come to you and am only speaking in languages given by the Spirit, how can that help you? That cannot help you unless I speak to you and help you know matters that were hidden from you, or unless I help you understand facts you did not know, or unless I proclaim to you some message you did not hear before, or unless I teach you some rule that you had never learned before.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_7" data-id="C114_7">If I played the flute or harp—and they are not living beings, unlike people, and if the flute sounded no different from the harp, no one would be able to tell which instrument I was playing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_8" data-id="C114_8">And if a soldier blew the trumpet poorly, the army would not know whether to get ready for battle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_9" data-id="C114_9">This is what it is like when you say words that no one can understand: no one will know what you have said. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_10" data-id="C114_10">There are certainly many languages in the world, and all of them give meaning to those who understand them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_11" data-id="C114_11">But if I do not understand someone's language, I will be like a foreigner to him, and he will be like one to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_12" data-id="C114_12">So because you want very much for the Spirit to work through you, try to help the believers in the church to trust Christ and obey him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_13" data-id="C114_13">For that reason, pray that God will enable you to interpret what you say in a language that God has given you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_14" data-id="C114_14">If anyone prays in such a language, his spirit certainly prays, but his mind does not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_15" data-id="C114_15">Therefore, we should pray with our spirit, but also pray with our mind. And it is the same if we sing praise to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_16" data-id="C114_16">If you insist on praising God only in your spirit, the outsider will never understand what you are saying, and will never be able to agree with the message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_17" data-id="C114_17">For if you give thanks in your spirit, that is well and good for you, but you are not helping the other believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_18" data-id="C114_18">I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_19" data-id="C114_19">But to the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, words with which I can teach others, than say ten thousand words in a language that God gives me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_20" data-id="C114_20">Brothers and sisters, you should be like children who do not commit many kinds of sin. But when you think about yourselves and God, you should think well, and not like children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">In the law it is written that God says, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">"I will speak to my people Israel</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">by foreigners, men who speak in strange languages;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C114_21" data-id="C114_21">and my people will not understand me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_22" data-id="C114_22">So if a believer speaks in a language that God has given him, this impresses the unbelievers who might be listening. But if a believer speaks a message from God, this impresses the other believers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_23" data-id="C114_23">You can seen how confusing it would be if all the believers met together and spoke in different languages. Any unbeliever who heard them would call them all crazy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_24" data-id="C114_24">But if you were all taking turns speaking true messages from God, any unbeliever would realize that he was guilty of sinning against God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_25" data-id="C114_25">God would tell the others there what this unbeliever was truly thinking. He would fall down with his face to the ground in wonder and fright, and he would praise God and say that God is truly with you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_26" data-id="C114_26">Brothers and sisters, it should be this way when you worship God together. Each of you should come with a psalm to sing, or something to teach from the Scriptures, or something that God has told you, or with a message in a language that God has given, or with an interpretation of such a message. Everything you do together should encourage each other, for you are Christ's church.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_27" data-id="C114_27">If there are any who wish to speak a message in a language from God, there should be no more than two or three such persons. They should speak one at a time, and someone should interpret the messages.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_28" data-id="C114_28">However, if there is no one able to interpret those messages, then those who speak in languages from God should keep silent and speak only to God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_29" data-id="C114_29">If there are any who want to speak a message from God, there should be only two or three such persons; and everyone else should judge those messages according to what the Scriptures say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_30" data-id="C114_30">But if God allows someone seated in the assembly to understand a message, then the one speaking the message should stop speaking. In this way, all the believers can listen to the meaning of the message.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_31" data-id="C114_31">For each of those who proclaim the messages of God should do so. But they must do so one by one, in order, so that all the believers can learn and receive courage to love God better. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_32" data-id="C114_32">For those who truly speak God's messages control the spirit in which they do so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_33" data-id="C114_33">For God does not create confusion; instead, he makes peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v C114_33" data-id="C114_33">This is what we do in all the churches of those whom God has set apart for himself:</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_34" data-id="C114_34">let the women keep silent in church; they are not permitted to speak. They must not interrupt the one who is speaking God's message, but they should always obey their husbands, as also the law says.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_35" data-id="C114_35">When women want to learn, instead of interrupting the worship, they should speak with their husbands at home. It dishonors her husband for a woman to interrupt the service.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_36" data-id="C114_36">Were you the people by whom God gave us his word? Or are you the only ones to whom it came?</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_37" data-id="C114_37">If there is any prophet or any who is spiritual among you, he will understand that the things I write are what the Lord has commanded, and he will follow what I have written. </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_38" data-id="C114_38">But if anyone does not acknowledge what I have written, you should not acknowledge him in your assembly.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_39" data-id="C114_39">So, brothers and sisters, with earnest desire speak God's messages to the church; and do not forbid anyone from speaking in languages that God gives.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v C114_40" data-id="C114_40">All that you do in the worship of the church, should be done with decorum and in proper order. </span>

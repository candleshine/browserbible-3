<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_1" data-id="RV11_1">Then an angel gave to me a reed similar to a measuring stick. God said to me, "Go to the temple, measure it and the altar in it, and count the people who are worshiping there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_2" data-id="RV11_2">But do not measure the courtyard outside of the temple building because I have given it to the non-Jewish people groups. As a result, they will trample the city of Jerusalem for forty-two months. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_3" data-id="RV11_3">I will send two witnesses to announce what I reveal to them for 1,260 days. They will show they are sad about the people's sin by wearing rough clothes made from goat's hair."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_4" data-id="RV11_4">Those witnesses are the ones that are represented by the two olive trees and the two lampstands that are in the presence of the Lord, who rules the earth. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_5" data-id="RV11_5">If anyone tries to harm those witnesses, fire comes from the witnesses' mouths and destroys them. If people want to harm them, the two witnesses certainly kill them in the same way. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_6" data-id="RV11_6">Those witnesses will have authority over the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the time that they are announcing what God reveals to them. They also will have authority to cause water everywhere to become blood; they will also have authority to send down to the earth all kinds of plagues. They will do this as often as they wish. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_7" data-id="RV11_7">When they have finished announcing to people the message from God, the beast that comes up from the underworld will attack them, overcome them, and kill them. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_8" data-id="RV11_8">The dead bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where their Lord was crucified, the city that is symbolically called Sodom or Egypt because its people are very evil like the people who lived in Sodom and Egypt. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_9" data-id="RV11_9">Individuals of many people groups, tribes, language groups, and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days. But they will not allow anyone to bury their bodies. </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_10" data-id="RV11_10">When the people who live on the earth see that the witnesses are dead, they will rejoice and celebrate. They will send gifts to each other because these two prophets had sent plagues that tormented them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_11" data-id="RV11_11">But after three and a half days, God will cause them to breathe again and live. They will stand up, and the people who see them will be terrified. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_12" data-id="RV11_12">The two witnesses will hear a loud voice from heaven saying to them: "Come up here!" Then they will go up into heaven in a cloud. Their enemies will watch them go up. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_13" data-id="RV11_13">At that same time there will be a great earthquake, as a result of which a tenth of the buildings in the city will collapse, and seven thousand people will die. The rest of the people will be afraid and will acknowledge that the God who rules in heaven is awesome.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_14" data-id="RV11_14">That will be the second terrible event. Be aware that the third terrible event will happen soon after.</span>

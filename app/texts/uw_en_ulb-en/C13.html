<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_1" data-id="C13_1">And I, brothers and sisters, could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as to fleshly people, as to babes in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_2" data-id="C13_2">I fed you milk and not meat, for you were not ready for meat. And even now you are not ready.  </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_3" data-id="C13_3">For you are still fleshly. For where jealousy and strife exist among you, are you not living according to the flesh, and are you not walking by human standards?</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_4" data-id="C13_4">For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another says, "I follow Apollos," are you not living as human beings?</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_5" data-id="C13_5">Who then is Apollos? And who is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, to each of whom the Lord gave tasks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_6" data-id="C13_6">I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_7" data-id="C13_7">So then, neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything. But it is God who gives the growth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_8" data-id="C13_8">Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own wages according to his own labor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_9" data-id="C13_9">For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's garden, God's building.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_10" data-id="C13_10">According to the grace of God that was given to me as a skilled master builder, I laid a foundation and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_11" data-id="C13_11">For no one can lay a foundation other than the one which has been laid, that is, Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_12" data-id="C13_12">Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_13" data-id="C13_13">his work will be revealed, for the daylight will reveal it. For it will be revealed in fire; the fire will test the quality of what each one had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_14" data-id="C13_14">If anything a person builds remains, he will receive a reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_15" data-id="C13_15">But if anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss. But he himself will be saved, as though escaping through fire.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_16" data-id="C13_16">Do you not know that you are God's temple and that the Spirit of God lives in you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_17" data-id="C13_17">If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person. For God's temple is holy, and so are you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_18" data-id="C13_18">Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a "fool" that he may become wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_19" data-id="C13_19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v C13_19" data-id="C13_19">"He catches the wise in their craftiness."</span>

<span class="v C13_20" data-id="C13_20">"The Lord knows that the reasoning of the wise is futile."</span>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_21" data-id="C13_21">So no more boasting about people! For all things are yours,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_22" data-id="C13_22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All things are yours,</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C13_23" data-id="C13_23">and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_1" data-id="AC24_1">After five days, Ananias the chief priest, certain elders, and an orator named Tertullus, went there. These men brought charges against Paul to the governor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_2" data-id="AC24_2">When Paul stood before the governor, Tertullus began to accuse him and said to the governor, "Because of you we have great peace; and your foresight brings good reform to our nation;</span>

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_3" data-id="AC24_3">so  with all thankfulness we welcome everything that you do, most excellent Felix.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_4" data-id="AC24_4">So that I detain you no more, I ask you to briefly listen to me with kindness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_5" data-id="AC24_5">For we have found this man to be a pest and one who causes all the Jews throughout the world to rebel. He is a leader of the Nazarene sect.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_6" data-id="AC24_6">He even tried to desecrate the temple; so we arrested him.  <span class="note" id="note-5"><a class="key" href="#footnote-5">5</a><span class="text">the best ancient copies omit the second part of 24:6 <em>"And we wanted to judge him according to our law" </em></span></span></span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_10" data-id="AC24_10">But when the governor motioned for Paul to speak, Paul answered, "I understand that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, and so I gladly explain myself to you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_11" data-id="AC24_11">You are able to verify that it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_12" data-id="AC24_12">and when they found me in the temple, I did not argue with anyone, and I did not stir up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city;</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_13" data-id="AC24_13">and they cannot prove to you the accusations that they make against me now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_14" data-id="AC24_14">But I admit this to you, that according to the way that they call a sect, in that same way I serve the God of our forefathers. I am faithful to all that is in the law and the writings of the prophets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_15" data-id="AC24_15">I have the same confidence in God, just as these men also wait for it, the coming resurrection of the dead, of both the righteous ones and the unrighteous ones;</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_16" data-id="AC24_16">and in this, I work to have a conscience without blame before God and men through all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_17" data-id="AC24_17">Now after many years I came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_18" data-id="AC24_18">When I did this, certain Jews from Asia found me in a purification ceremony in the temple, not with a crowd or an uproar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_19" data-id="AC24_19">These men ought to be before you now and say what they have against me, if they have anything.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_20" data-id="AC24_20">Or else, these same men should say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the Jewish council;</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_21" data-id="AC24_21">unless it is about this one thing that I said out loud when I stood among them, 'It is about the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged today by you.'"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_22" data-id="AC24_22">Felix was well informed about the Way, and so he made the Jews wait. He said, "Whenever Lysias the commander comes down from Jerusalem I will decide your case."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_23" data-id="AC24_23">Then he commanded the centurion to guard Paul, but to have leniency, and that no one should stop his friends from helping him or from visiting him.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_24" data-id="AC24_24">After some days, Felix returned with Druscilla his wife, a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and he heard from him about faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_25" data-id="AC24_25">But when Paul reasoned with him about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became fearful; and, he answered, "Go away for the present, but when I have time again, I will call you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_26" data-id="AC24_26">At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would give money to him, so he often sent for him and spoke with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC24_27" data-id="AC24_27">But when two years passed, Porcius Festus became the governor after Felix, but Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jews, so he left Paul to continue under guard.</span>

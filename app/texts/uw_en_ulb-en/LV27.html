<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_1" data-id="LV27_1">Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_2" data-id="LV27_2">"Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, 'When a man makes a special vow that requires him to use a standard value of a person he dedicates to Yahweh, use the following values.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_3" data-id="LV27_3">Your standard value for a male from twenty to sixty years old must be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_4" data-id="LV27_4">For a female of the same ages your standard value must be thirty shekels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_5" data-id="LV27_5">From five years to twenty years old your standard value for a male must be twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_6" data-id="LV27_6">From one month old to five years your standard value for a male must be five shekels of silver, and for a female three shekels of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_7" data-id="LV27_7">From sixty years old and up for a male your standard value must be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_8" data-id="LV27_8">But if the person making the vow cannot pay the standard value, then the person being given must be presented to the priest, and the priest will value that person by the amount the one making the vow is able to afford.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_9" data-id="LV27_9">If someone wants to sacrifice an animal to Yahweh, and if Yahweh accepts it, then that animal will be dedicated to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_10" data-id="LV27_10">The person must not alter or change such an animal, a good one for a bad one or a bad for a good. If he does at all change one animal for another, then both it and the one for which it is exchanged become holy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_11" data-id="LV27_11">However, if what the person has vowed to give Yahweh is in fact unclean, so that Yahweh will not accept it, then the person must bring the animal to a priest. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_12" data-id="LV27_12">The priest will value it, by the market value of the animal. Whatever value the priest places on the animal, that will be its value.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_13" data-id="LV27_13">And if the owner wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_14" data-id="LV27_14">When a man desires to dedicate his house to be set apart for Yahweh, then the priest will estimate its value. Whatever the priest values it at, that will be its value.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_15" data-id="LV27_15">But if the owner dedicates his home and later wishes to redeem it, then a fifth of its value is to be added to its redemption price, and then the house will be his again.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_16" data-id="LV27_16">If a man desires to dedicate to Yahweh some of his land, then the estimation of its value will be made in keeping with the amount of seed required to plant it. One homer of barley will be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_17" data-id="LV27_17">If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the estimated value will stand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_18" data-id="LV27_18">But if he dedicate his field after the Jubilee, then the priest must calculate the value of the field by the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and the estimated value must be reduced.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_19" data-id="LV27_19">If the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he must add a fifth to the estimated value, and it will be become his again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_20" data-id="LV27_20">If he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it cannot be redeemed any more. </span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_21" data-id="LV27_21">Instead, the field, when it is released in the Jubilee, will be a holy gift to Yahweh, like the field that has been completely given to Yahweh. It will belong to the priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_22" data-id="LV27_22">If a man dedicates to Yahweh a field that he has bought, but that field is not part of his family's land, </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_23" data-id="LV27_23">then the priest will figure the estimated value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_24" data-id="LV27_24">In the Year of Jubilee, the field will return to the man from whom it was bought, to the land's owner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_25" data-id="LV27_25">All the estimated values must be set by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. Twenty gerahs must be the equivalent of one shekel.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_26" data-id="LV27_26">But a firstborn among animals already belongs to Yahweh and no man may dedicate it—whether ox or sheep—for it belongs to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_27" data-id="LV27_27">If it is an unclean animal, then the owner may buy it back at the estimated value, and a fifth must be added to that value. If the animal is not redeemed, then it is to be sold at the set value.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_28" data-id="LV27_28">However, nothing a man dedicates to Yahweh from anything he has, whether human or animal, or his family land, may be sold or redeemed. Every dedicated thing is holy to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_29" data-id="LV27_29">No ransom may be paid for the person who is set apart to be destroyed. That person must be put to death. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_30" data-id="LV27_30">All the tithe of the land, whether grain grown on the land or fruit from the trees, is Yahweh's. It is holy to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_31" data-id="LV27_31">If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth to its value.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_32" data-id="LV27_32">As for all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd's rod, one tenth must be dedicated to Yahweh. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_33" data-id="LV27_33">The shepherd must not search for the better or the worse animals, and he must not substitute one for another. If he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy. It cannot be redeemed.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV27_34" data-id="LV27_34">These are the commandments that Yahweh gave at Mount Sinai to Moses for the people of Israel.</span>

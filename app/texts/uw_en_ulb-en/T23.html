<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_1" data-id="T23_1">But know this: in the last days dangerous times will come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_2" data-id="T23_2">For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_3" data-id="T23_3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, violent, not lovers of good,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_4" data-id="T23_4">betrayers, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_5" data-id="T23_5">They will have a form of godliness, but they will deny the power of it. Turn away from these people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_6" data-id="T23_6">For some of them are men who enter into households and captivate foolish women who are overwhelmed with sins and are led away by various desires.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_7" data-id="T23_7">These women are always trying to learn new  things, yet they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_8" data-id="T23_8">In the same way that Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so these false teachers also stand against the truth. They are corrupted in mind and they have rejected the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_9" data-id="T23_9">But they will not advance very far, for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just like the foolishness of those two men.    </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_10" data-id="T23_10">But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_11" data-id="T23_11">persecutions, sufferings, and what happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra. I endured such persecutions, and out of them all, the Lord rescued me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_12" data-id="T23_12">All those who want to live in a godly manner in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_13" data-id="T23_13">Evil people and impostors will become even worse, while they lead others astray and are themselves being led astray.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_14" data-id="T23_14">But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you have learned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_15" data-id="T23_15">You know that from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_16" data-id="T23_16">All scripture has been inspired by God and is profitable for doctrine, for conviction, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T23_17" data-id="T23_17">in order that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.</span>

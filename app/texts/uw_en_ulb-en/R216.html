<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_1" data-id="R216_1">In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha, king of Israel, acted aggressively against Judah and built up Ramah, so that he might not allow anyone to leave or enter into the land of Asa, king of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_2" data-id="R216_2">Then Asa brought the silver and gold out of the storerooms in the house of Yahweh and of the king's house, and sent it to Ben Hadad king of Aram, who lived in Damascus. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_3" data-id="R216_3">"Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Look, I have sent to you silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he may leave me alone."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_4" data-id="R216_4">Ben Hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_5" data-id="R216_5">It came about that when Baasha heard this, he stopped building up Ramah, and let his work cease.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_6" data-id="R216_6">Then Asa the king took all Judah with him. They carried away the stones and timbers of Ramah with which Baasha had been building up the city. Then King Asa used that building material to build up Geba and Mizpah.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_7" data-id="R216_7">At that time Hanani the seer went to Asa, king of Judah, and said to him, "Because you have relied on the king of Aram, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped out of your hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_8" data-id="R216_8">Were not the Ethiopians and the Libyans a huge army, with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he gave you victory over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_9" data-id="R216_9">For the eyes of Yahweh run everywhere throughout the whole earth, so that he might show himself strong on behalf of those whose hearts are perfect toward him. But you have acted foolishly in this matter. From now one, you will have war."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_10" data-id="R216_10">Then Asa was angry with the seer; he put him into prison, for he was angry with him over this matter. At the same time, Asa oppressed some of the people.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_12" data-id="R216_12">In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was very severe. Even so, he did not seek help from Yahweh, but only from physicians.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_13" data-id="R216_13">Asa slept with his ancestors; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R216_14" data-id="R216_14">They buried him in his own sepulchre, which he had dug out for himself in the city of David. They laid him on a bier that was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by skilled perfumers. Then they made a very great fire in his honor.</span>

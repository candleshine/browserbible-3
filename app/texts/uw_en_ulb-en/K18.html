<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_1" data-id="K18_1">Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families of the people of Israel, before himself in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, that is, Zion.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_2" data-id="K18_2">All the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the feast, in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_3" data-id="K18_3">All the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_4" data-id="K18_4">They brought up the ark of Yahweh, the tent of meeting, and all the holy furnishings that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought these things up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_5" data-id="K18_5">King Solomon and all the assembly of Israel came together before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_6" data-id="K18_6">The priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, into the inner room of the house, to the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_7" data-id="K18_7">For the cherubim spread out their wings to the place of the ark, and they covered the ark and the poles by which it was carried.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_8" data-id="K18_8">The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the most holy place, but they could not be seen from outside. They are there to this day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_9" data-id="K18_9">There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses had put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the people of Israel when they came out of the land of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_10" data-id="K18_10">It came about that when the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the temple of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_11" data-id="K18_11">The priests could not stand to serve because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled his house.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_12" data-id="K18_12">Then Solomon said,</span>

</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v K18_12" data-id="K18_12">he would live in thick darkness,</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_13" data-id="K18_13">But I have built you </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v K18_13" data-id="K18_13">a lofty residence, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v K18_13" data-id="K18_13">a place for you to live in forever."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_14" data-id="K18_14">Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel was standing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_15" data-id="K18_15">He said,  "May Yahweh, the God of Israel, be praised, who spoke to David, my father, and has fulfilled it with his own hands, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_16" data-id="K18_16">'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, in order for my name to be there. However, I chose David to rule over my people Israel.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_17" data-id="K18_17">Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_18" data-id="K18_18">But Yahweh said to David, my father, 'In that it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well for it to be in your heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_19" data-id="K18_19">Nevertheless you will not build the house; instead, your  son, one who will be born from your loins, will build the house for my name.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_20" data-id="K18_20">Yahweh has carried out the word that he had said, for I have arisen in the place of David, my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised. I have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_21" data-id="K18_21">I have made a place for the ark there, in which is Yahweh's covenant, which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_22" data-id="K18_22">Solomon stood before the altar of Yahweh, before all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_23" data-id="K18_23">He said, "Yahweh, God of Israel, there is no god like you in the heavens above or on the earth below, who keeps his covenant faithfulness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart;</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_24" data-id="K18_24">you who have kept with your servant David, my father, what you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_25" data-id="K18_25">Now then, Yahweh, God of Israel, carry out what you have promised to your servant David, my father, when you said, 'You will not fail to have a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants are careful to walk before me, as you have walked before me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_26" data-id="K18_26">Now then, God of Israel, I pray that the promise you made to your servant David, my father, will come true.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_27" data-id="K18_27">But will God actually live on the earth? Look, the entire universe and heaven itself cannot contain you—how much less can this temple that I have built!</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_28" data-id="K18_28">Yet please respect this prayer of your servant and his request, Yahweh my God; listen to the cry and prayer that your servant prays before you today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_29" data-id="K18_29">May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, to the place about which you have said, 'My name and my presence will be there'—in order to listen to the prayers that your servant will pray toward this place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_30" data-id="K18_30">So listen to the request of your servant and of your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, listen from the place where you live, from the heavens; and when you listen, forgive.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_31" data-id="K18_31">If a man sins against his neighbor and is required to swear an oath, and if he comes and swears an oath before your altar in this house, </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_32" data-id="K18_32">then hear in the heavens and act and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his conduct on his own head. And declare the righteous innocent, to give him the reward for his righteousness.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_33" data-id="K18_33">When your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, if they turn back to you, confess your name, pray, and request forgiveness from you in this temple—</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_34" data-id="K18_34">then please listen in the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel; bring them back to the land that you gave to their ancestors.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_35" data-id="K18_35">When the skies are shut up and there is no rain because the people have sinned against you—if they pray toward this place, confess your name, and turn from their sin when you have afflicted them— </span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_36" data-id="K18_36">then listen in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk. Send rain on your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_37" data-id="K18_37">Suppose there is famine in the land, or suppose that there is disease, blight or mildew, locusts or caterpillars; or suppose that an enemy attacks the city gates in their land, or that there is any  plague or sickness—</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_38" data-id="K18_38">and suppose then that prayers and requests are made by a person or by all your people Israel—each knowing the plague in his own heart as he spreads out his hands toward this temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_39" data-id="K18_39">Then listen from heaven, the place where you live, forgive and act, and reward every person for all he does; you know his heart, because you and you only know the hearts of all human beings. </span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_40" data-id="K18_40">Do this so that they may fear you all the days that they live on the land that you gave to our ancestors.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_41" data-id="K18_41">In addition, concerning the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel: when he comes from a distant country because of your name—</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_42" data-id="K18_42">for they will hear of your great name, your mighty hand, and your raised arm—when he comes and prays toward this temple,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_43" data-id="K18_43">then please listen from heaven, the place where you live, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you. Do this so that all the people groups on earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel.  Do this so they might know that this house I have built is called by your name.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_44" data-id="K18_44">Suppose that your people go out to battle against an enemy, by whatever way you may send them, and suppose that they pray to you, Yahweh, toward the city that you have chosen, and toward the house that I have built for your name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_45" data-id="K18_45">Then listen in the heavens to their prayer, their request, and help their cause.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_46" data-id="K18_46">Suppose that they sin against you, since  there is no one who does not sin, and suppose that you are angry with them and hand them over to the enemy, so that the enemy carries them away captive to their land, whether distant or near.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_47" data-id="K18_47">Then suppose that they realize they are in the land where they have been exiled, and suppose that they repent and seek favor from you from the land of their captors. Suppose that they say, 'We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly.' </span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_48" data-id="K18_48">Suppose that they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who captured them, and suppose that they pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their ancestors, and toward the city that you chose, and toward the house that I have built for your name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_49" data-id="K18_49">Then listen to their prayer, their requests in the heavens, the place where you live, and help their cause. </span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_50" data-id="K18_50">Forgive your people, who have sinned against you, and all their sins with which they have transgressed against your commands. Have compassion on them before their enemies who carried them captive, so that their enemies may also have compassion on your people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_51" data-id="K18_51">They are your people whom you have chosen, whom you rescued out of Egypt as if from the middle of a furnace where iron is forged.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_52" data-id="K18_52">I pray that your eyes may be open to the request of your servant, and to the requests of your people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_53" data-id="K18_53">For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to belong to you and receive your promises, just as you explained by Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord Yahweh." </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_54" data-id="K18_54">So it was that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and request to Yahweh, he arose from before the altar of Yahweh, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_55" data-id="K18_55">He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_56" data-id="K18_56">"May Yahweh be praised, who has given rest to his people Israel, keeping all his promises. Not one word has failed out of all Yahweh's good promises that he made with Moses his servant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-57">57&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_57" data-id="K18_57">May Yahweh our God be with us, as he was with our ancestors. May he never leave us or forsake us, </span>
<span class="v-num v-58">58&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_58" data-id="K18_58">that he may incline our hearts to him, to live in all his ways and keep his commandments and his statutes  and his decrees, which he commanded our fathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-59">59&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_59" data-id="K18_59">And let these words I have spoken, by which I have made request before Yahweh, be near  Yahweh our God day and night, so that he may help the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as every day will require;</span>
<span class="v-num v-60">60&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_60" data-id="K18_60">that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God, and there is no other God!</span>
<span class="v-num v-61">61&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_61" data-id="K18_61">Therefore let your heart be true to Yahweh our God, to walk in his statutes and keep his commandments, as on this day."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-62">62&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_62" data-id="K18_62">So the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-63">63&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_63" data-id="K18_63">Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings, which he made to Yahweh: twenty-two thousand oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-64">64&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_64" data-id="K18_64">The same day the king dedicated the middle of the courtyard in front of the temple of Yahweh, for there he offered the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too small to receive the burnt offering, the grain offerings, and the fat of the fellowship offerings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-65">65&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_65" data-id="K18_65">So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God for seven days and also for another seven days, a total of fourteen days.</span>
<span class="v-num v-66">66&nbsp;</span><span class="v K18_66" data-id="K18_66">On the final eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes with joyful and glad hearts for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David, his servant, and to Israel, his people.</span>

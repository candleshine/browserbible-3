<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_1" data-id="AC19_1">It came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to the city of Ephesus, and found certain disciples there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_2" data-id="AC19_2">Paul said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They said to him, "No, we did not even hear about the Holy Spirit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_3" data-id="AC19_3">Paul said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_4" data-id="AC19_4">So Paul replied, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance. He told the people that they should believe in the one who would come after him, that is, in Jesus."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_5" data-id="AC19_5">When the people heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_6" data-id="AC19_6">Then when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them and they spoke in other languages and prophesied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_7" data-id="AC19_7">In all they were about twelve men.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_8" data-id="AC19_8">Paul went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for the space of three months. He was leading discussions and persuading people about the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_9" data-id="AC19_9">But when some Jews were hardened and disobedient, they began to speak evil of the way of Christ before the crowd. So Paul left them and lead the believers away from them. He began to speak every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_10" data-id="AC19_10">This continued for two years, so that all who  lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_11" data-id="AC19_11">God was doing mighty deeds by the hands of Paul,</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_12" data-id="AC19_12">so that even the sick were healed, and evil spirits went out of them, when they took handkerchiefs and aprons from Paul's body. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_13" data-id="AC19_13">But there were Jewish exorcists traveling through the area who took the name of Jesus for their own use. They spoke it over those who had evil spirits; they said, "I command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches to leave."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_14" data-id="AC19_14">Those who did this were the seven sons of a Jewish chief priest, Sceva.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_15" data-id="AC19_15">An evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_16" data-id="AC19_16">The evil spirit in the man leaped on the exorcists and overpowered them and beat them up. Then they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_17" data-id="AC19_17">This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived at Ephesus. They became very afraid, and the name of the Lord Jesus was honored.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_18" data-id="AC19_18">Also, many of the believers came and confessed and admitted the evil things they had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_19" data-id="AC19_19">Many who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. When they counted the value of them, it was fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_20" data-id="AC19_20">So the word of the Lord spread very widely in powerful ways.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_21" data-id="AC19_21">Now after Paul completed his ministry in Ephesus, he decided in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem; he said, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_22" data-id="AC19_22">Paul sent  to Macedonia two of his disciples, Timothy and Erastus, who had helped him. But he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_23" data-id="AC19_23">At about that time there arose a great disturbance in Ephesus concerning the Way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_24" data-id="AC19_24">A certain silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver statues of Diana, brought in much business for the craftsmen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_25" data-id="AC19_25">So he gathered together the workmen of that occupation and said, "Sirs, you know that in this business we make much money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_26" data-id="AC19_26">You see and hear that, not only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people.  He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_27" data-id="AC19_27">And not only is there danger that our trade will no longer be needed, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana may be considered worthless.  Then she would even lose her greatness, she whom all Asia and the world worships."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_28" data-id="AC19_28">When they heard this they were filled with anger and cried out, saying, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_29" data-id="AC19_29">The whole city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed together into the theater.  They had seized Paul's travel companions, Gaius and Aristarchus, who came from Macedonia. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_30" data-id="AC19_30">Paul wanted to enter in among the crowd of people, but the disciples prevented him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_31" data-id="AC19_31">Also, some of the local officials who were friends of Paul sent a message to him asking him not to enter the theater.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_32" data-id="AC19_32">Some people were shouting one thing, and some another, for the crowd was in confusion. Most of them did not even know why they had come together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_33" data-id="AC19_33">The Jews brought Alexander out of the crowd  putting him up front of the people. Alexander motioned with his hand to make an explanation to the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_34" data-id="AC19_34">But when they realized that he was a Jew, they all cried out with one voice for about two hours, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_35" data-id="AC19_35">When the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "You men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from heaven?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_36" data-id="AC19_36">Seeing then that these things are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_37" data-id="AC19_37">For you have brought these men to this court who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_38" data-id="AC19_38">Therefore, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have an accusation against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_39" data-id="AC19_39">But if you seek anything about other matters, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_40" data-id="AC19_40">For indeed we are in danger of being accused  concerning this day's riot. There is no cause for this disorder, and we will not be able to explain it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC19_41" data-id="AC19_41">When he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</span>

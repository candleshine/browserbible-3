<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_18" data-id="LV21_18">Any man who has a bodily defect must not approach Yahweh, such as a blind man, a lame man, one who is disfigured or deformed,</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_22" data-id="LV21_22">He may eat the food of his God, whether some of the most holy or some of the holy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_23" data-id="LV21_23">However, he must not enter inside the curtain or come near the altar, because he has a bodily defect, so  that he does not defile my holy place, for I am Yahweh, who dedicates them to myself.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v LV21_24" data-id="LV21_24">So Moses spoke these words to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the people of Israel.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_1" data-id="HB10_1">For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not those realities themselves. The law can never make perfect those who draw near to God by means of the same sacrifices that the priests continually offer year after year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_2" data-id="HB10_2">Or else would not those sacrifices have ceased to be offered? In that case the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more awareness of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_3" data-id="HB10_3">But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins committed year after year.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_4" data-id="HB10_4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_5" data-id="HB10_5">When Christ came into the world, he said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_5" data-id="HB10_5">"You did not desire sacrifices or offerings.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_5" data-id="HB10_5">Instead, you prepared a body for me.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_6" data-id="HB10_6">You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings or sacrifices for sin. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_7" data-id="HB10_7">Then I said, "See, here I am to do your will, God, as it is written about me in the scroll."</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_8" data-id="HB10_8">He said as is stated above: "You did not desire sacrifices, offerings, or whole burnt offerings for sin, nor did you take pleasure in them"—sacrifices that are offered according to the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_9" data-id="HB10_9">Then he said, "See, I am here to do your will." He sets aside the first practice in order to establish the second.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_10" data-id="HB10_10">In the second practice, we have been dedicated to God by his will through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_11" data-id="HB10_11">Indeed, every priest stands day by day serving, offering the same sacrifices, which, however, can never take away sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_12" data-id="HB10_12">But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins forever, he sat down at the right hand of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_13" data-id="HB10_13">waiting until his enemies were humbled and made a stool for his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_14" data-id="HB10_14">For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are dedicated to God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_15" data-id="HB10_15">And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us. For first he said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">" 'This is the covenant that I will make with them</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">after those days,' says the Lord:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">'I will put my laws in their hearts,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_16" data-id="HB10_16">and I will write them on their minds.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_17" data-id="HB10_17">Then he said, "No more will I remember their sins and acts of lawlessness."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_18" data-id="HB10_18">Now where there is forgiveness for these things, there offerings are no longer made for sin.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_19" data-id="HB10_19">Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_20" data-id="HB10_20">That is the way that he has opened for us by means of his body, a new and living way through the curtain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_21" data-id="HB10_21">And because we have a great priest over the house of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_22" data-id="HB10_22">let us draw near with a true heart in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our body washed with pure water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_23" data-id="HB10_23">Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our confident expectation, without wavering, because God who has promised is faithful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_24" data-id="HB10_24">Let us consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_25" data-id="HB10_25">Let us not stop assembling together, as some have done. Instead, encourage one another more and more, as you see the day drawing near.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_26" data-id="HB10_26">For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer exists.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_27" data-id="HB10_27">Instead, there is only a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierce fire that will consume God's enemies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_28" data-id="HB10_28">Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_29" data-id="HB10_29">How much more punishment do you think anyone deserves who has trampled on the Son of God, anyone who has treated the blood of the covenant as something unholy, the blood by which he was dedicated to God—anyone who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_30" data-id="HB10_30">For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay back." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_31" data-id="HB10_31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_32" data-id="HB10_32">But remember the former days, after you were enlightened—how you endured a great agony of suffering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_33" data-id="HB10_33">You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution, and you were participants with those who went through such suffering.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_34" data-id="HB10_34">For you had compassion on those who were prisoners, and you accepted with joy the seizure of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves had a better and everlasting possession.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_35" data-id="HB10_35">So do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_36" data-id="HB10_36">For you need patience, so that you may receive what God has promised, after you have done his will.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_37" data-id="HB10_37">"For in a very little while,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_37" data-id="HB10_37">the one who is coming will indeed come and not delay.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_38" data-id="HB10_38">My righteous one will live by faith.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB10_38" data-id="HB10_38">If he turns back, I will not be pleased with him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB10_39" data-id="HB10_39">But we are not some of those who turn back to destruction. Instead, we are some of those who have faith for keeping our soul.</span>

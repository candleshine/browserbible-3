<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_1" data-id="C110_1">I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_2" data-id="C110_2">All were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_3" data-id="C110_3">and all ate the same spiritual food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_4" data-id="C110_4">All drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_5" data-id="C110_5">But God was not well pleased with most of them, and their corpses were scattered about in the wilderness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_6" data-id="C110_6">Now these things were examples for us, so we would not long for evil things as they did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_7" data-id="C110_7">Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. This is as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to dance with sexual desires."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_8" data-id="C110_8">Let us not commit sexual immorality, as many of them did. Twenty-three thousand died in one day because of it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_9" data-id="C110_9">Neither let us put Christ to the test, as many of them did and were destroyed by snakes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_10" data-id="C110_10">Also do not grumble, as many of them did, and were destroyed by an angel of death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_11" data-id="C110_11">Now these things happened to them as examples for us. They were written for our instructionâ€”for us on whom the end of the ages has come. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_12" data-id="C110_12">Therefore let anyone who thinks he stands be careful that he does not fall.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_13" data-id="C110_13">No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to all humanity. Instead, God is faithful: he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. With the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may be able to endure it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_14" data-id="C110_14">Therefore, my loved ones, run away from idolatry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_15" data-id="C110_15">I speak to you as thoughtful people, so you may judge what I say.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_16" data-id="C110_16">The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ?</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_17" data-id="C110_17">Because there is one loaf of bread, we who are many are one body. We all take of one loaf of bread together.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_18" data-id="C110_18">Look at the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_19" data-id="C110_19">What am I saying then? That an idol is anything? Or that food sacrificed to an idol is anything?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_20" data-id="C110_20">But I say about the things the Gentile pagans sacrifice, that they offer these things to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons!</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_21" data-id="C110_21">You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot have fellowship at the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_22" data-id="C110_22">Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he is?</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_23" data-id="C110_23">"Everything is lawful," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful," but not everything builds people up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_24" data-id="C110_24">No one should seek his own good. Instead, each one should seek the good of his neighbor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_25" data-id="C110_25">You may eat whatever is sold in the market, without questions of conscience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_26" data-id="C110_26">For "The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness of it." </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_27" data-id="C110_27">If an unbeliever invites you to eat a meal, and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_28" data-id="C110_28">But if someone says to you, "This food was from a pagan sacrifice," do not eat it. This is for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_29" data-id="C110_29">I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person's conscience. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_30" data-id="C110_30">If I partake of the meal with gratitude, why am I being insulted for that for which I gave thanks?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_31" data-id="C110_31">Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_32" data-id="C110_32">Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks, or to the church of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v C110_33" data-id="C110_33">Try as I try to please all people in all things. I do not seek my benefit, but that of the many. I do this so that they may be saved.</span>

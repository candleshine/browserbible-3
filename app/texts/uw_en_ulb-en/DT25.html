<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_6" data-id="DT25_6">This is so that the firstborn that she bears will succeed in the name of that man's dead brother, so that his name will not perish from Israel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT25_7" data-id="DT25_7">But if the man does not wish to take his brother's wife for himself, then his brother's wife must go up to the gate to the elders and say, 'My husband's brother refuses to raise up for his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's brother to me.'</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_1" data-id="RV4_1">After these things I looked, and I saw that a door had opened in heaven. The first voice, speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_2" data-id="RV4_2">At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw there was a throne placed in heaven, with someone sitting on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_3" data-id="RV4_3">The one who was sitting on it looked like jasper and carnelian. There was a rainbow around the throne. The rainbow looked like an emerald.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_4" data-id="RV4_4">Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, dressed with white garments, with gold crowns on their heads. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_5" data-id="RV4_5">From the throne came bolts of lightning, rumblings, and crashes of thunder. Seven lamps were burning in front of the throne, lamps that were the seven Spirits of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_6" data-id="RV4_6">Also before the throne was a sea, clear as crystal. All around the throne were four living creatures, full of eyes front and back.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_7" data-id="RV4_7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_8" data-id="RV4_8">The four living creatures each had six wings, full of eyes on top and underneath. Night and day they do not stop saying,</span>

<span class="v RV4_8" data-id="RV4_8">"Holy, holy, holy </span>

<span class="v RV4_8" data-id="RV4_8">is the Lord God, the ruler over all, </span>

<span class="v RV4_8" data-id="RV4_8">who was, and who is, and who is to come."</span>

<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_9" data-id="RV4_9">Whenever the living creatures gave glory, honor, and thanks to the one who was seated on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV4_10" data-id="RV4_10">the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves before the one sitting on the throne. They bowed down to the one living forever and ever, and they threw down their crowns before the throne, saying,</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_1" data-id="MK9_1">Jesus said to them, "Truly I say to you, there are some of you who are standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_2" data-id="MK9_2">Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and brought them up a high mountain by themselves. Then he was transfigured before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_3" data-id="MK9_3">His garments became radiantly brilliant, extremely white, whiter than any bleacher on earth could bleach them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_4" data-id="MK9_4">Then Elijah with Moses appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_5" data-id="MK9_5">Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here and we should make three shelters. Let us make one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_6" data-id="MK9_6">(For Peter did not know what to say. The disciples were all terrified.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_7" data-id="MK9_7">A cloud came and overshadowed them. Then a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son. Listen to him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_8" data-id="MK9_8">Suddenly, when they looked round, they no longer saw anyone with them, but only Jesus.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_9" data-id="MK9_9">As they were coming down the mountain, he commanded them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_10" data-id="MK9_10">So they kept the matter to themselves, but  they discussed among themselves what "to rise from the dead" could mean.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_11" data-id="MK9_11">They asked him, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_12" data-id="MK9_12">He said to them, "Elijah does indeed come first so he can restore all things. Then why is it written that Son of Man must suffer many things and that people will hate him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_13" data-id="MK9_13">But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they wanted to him, just as scripture says about him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_14" data-id="MK9_14">When they came back to where the other disciples were, they saw a great crowd around them, and the scribes were arguing with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_15" data-id="MK9_15">When they saw Jesus, the whole crowd was greatly amazed; they ran up to him and gave him a warm welcome.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_16" data-id="MK9_16">He asked his disciples, "What are you arguing with them about?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_17" data-id="MK9_17">One of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought you my son; he has a spirit that makes him unable to speak,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_18" data-id="MK9_18">and it causes him to have convulsions and throws him down; he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they could not."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_19" data-id="MK9_19">He answered them, "Unbelieving generation, how long will I have to stay with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him to me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_20" data-id="MK9_20">They brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw him into a convulsion. The boy fell on the ground and foamed at the mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_21" data-id="MK9_21">Jesus asked his father, "How long has he been like this?" The father said, "Since childhood.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_22" data-id="MK9_22">It has often thrown him into the fire or into the waters and tried to destroy him. If you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_23" data-id="MK9_23">Jesus said to him, "'If you are able'? All things are possible for the one who believes."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_24" data-id="MK9_24">Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe! Help my unbelief!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_25" data-id="MK9_25">When Jesus saw the crowd running to them, he rebuked the unclean spirit and said, "You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter into him again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_26" data-id="MK9_26">It cried out and convulsed the boy greatly and then came out. The boy looked like one who was dead, so much so that most of the people said, "He is dead."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_27" data-id="MK9_27">But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and the boy stood up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_28" data-id="MK9_28">When Jesus came into the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_29" data-id="MK9_29">He said to them, "This kind cannot be cast out except by prayer."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_30" data-id="MK9_30">They went out from there and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_31" data-id="MK9_31">for he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man will be delivered over into the hands of men, and they will put him to death. When he has been put to death, after three days he will rise again."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_32" data-id="MK9_32">But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_33" data-id="MK9_33">They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house he asked his disciples, "What were you discussing along the way?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_34" data-id="MK9_34">But they were silent. For they had been arguing with one with another along the way about who was the greatest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_35" data-id="MK9_35">He sat down and called the Twelve together. He said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_36" data-id="MK9_36">He took a little child and placed him in their midst. He took the child in his arms and said to them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_37" data-id="MK9_37">"Whoever receives such a child in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he does not receive  me alone, but also the one who sent me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_38" data-id="MK9_38">John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we stopped him, because he does not follow us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_39" data-id="MK9_39">But Jesus said, "Do not stop him. For no one able to do a mighty work in my name will soon be able to say anything bad about me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_40" data-id="MK9_40">Whoever is not against us is for us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_41" data-id="MK9_41">Whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_42" data-id="MK9_42">Whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_43" data-id="MK9_43">If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_44" data-id="MK9_44"><span class="note" id="note-2"><a class="key" href="#footnote-2">2</a><span class="text">The best ancient copies omit this phrase from verses 44 and 46, <em>"where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched" </em></span></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_45" data-id="MK9_45">If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, than to have your two feet, and be thrown into hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_46" data-id="MK9_46"><span class="note" id="note-3"><a class="key" href="#footnote-3">3</a><span class="text">See note on verse 44. </span></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_47" data-id="MK9_47">If your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out. It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than to have two eyes and to be thrown into hell,</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_48" data-id="MK9_48">where their worm does not die, and the fire is not put out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_49" data-id="MK9_49">For everyone will be salted with fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK9_50" data-id="MK9_50">Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_1" data-id="EC5_1">Guard your conduct when you go to the house of God. Go there to listen. Listening is better than when fools offer sacrifices while not knowing that what they do in life is wicked.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">Do not be too quick to speak with your mouth, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">and do not let your heart be too quick to bring any matter up before God. </span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">God is in heaven, but you are on earth, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC5_2" data-id="EC5_2">so let your words be few.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_5" data-id="EC5_5">It is better not to make a vow than to make one that you do not carry out.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_6" data-id="EC5_6">Do not allow your mouth to cause your flesh to sin. Do not say to the priest's messenger, "That vow was a mistake." Why make God angry by vowing falsely, provoking God to destroy the work of your hands?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_7" data-id="EC5_7">For in many dreams, as in many words, there is meaningless vapor. So fear God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_8" data-id="EC5_8">When you see the poor being oppressed and robbed of just and right treatment in your province, do not be astonished as if no one knows, because there are men in power who watch those under them, and there are even higher ones over them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_9" data-id="EC5_9">In addition, the produce of the land is for everyone, and the king himself takes produce from the fields.</span>

For this is man's assignment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC5_19" data-id="EC5_19">Anyone to whom God has given riches and wealth and the ability to receive his share and rejoice in his workâ€”this is a gift from God.</span>

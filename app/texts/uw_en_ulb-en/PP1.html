<div class="mt">The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_1" data-id="PP1_1">Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the ones set apart in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_2" data-id="PP1_2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_3" data-id="PP1_3">I thank my God with every thought of you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_4" data-id="PP1_4">Every time I pray for you, it is always a prayer of joy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_5" data-id="PP1_5">I give thanks for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_6" data-id="PP1_6">I am confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_7" data-id="PP1_7">It is right for me to feel this way about all of you because I have you in my heart. You all have been my partners in grace both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_8" data-id="PP1_8">For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the depths of the love of Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_9" data-id="PP1_9">And I am praying that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and complete understanding.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_10" data-id="PP1_10">I do this so that you may test and choose the things that are excellent in order that you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_11" data-id="PP1_11">and that you will be filled with the fruits of righteousness that come through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_12" data-id="PP1_12">Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things that happened to me have advanced the progress of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_13" data-id="PP1_13">This is because my imprisonment for the sake of Christ became known throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_14" data-id="PP1_14">Now most of the brothers in the Lord, becoming confident because of my imprisonment, speak the word of God with more boldness and without fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_15" data-id="PP1_15">Some indeed even proclaim Christ out of envy and strife, and others also out of good will.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_16" data-id="PP1_16">The ones who proclaim Christ out of love know that I have been assigned to defend the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_17" data-id="PP1_17">But the others proclaim Christ out of selfish and insincere motives. They think they are adding to the affliction I suffer in my imprisonment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_18" data-id="PP1_18">So what? Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and I rejoice in that! Yes, I will rejoice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_19" data-id="PP1_19">For I know that this will lead to my deliverance because of your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_20" data-id="PP1_20">It is my confident expectation and certainty that I will not be ashamed. But with all courage, as always and especially right now, I will bring glory to Christ in my body, whether by life or by death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_21" data-id="PP1_21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_22" data-id="PP1_22">But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor, then I do not know which to choose. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_23" data-id="PP1_23">For I am pulled by both of these choices. I have the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is much, much better!</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_24" data-id="PP1_24">Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_25" data-id="PP1_25">Since I am confident about this, I know that I will remain, yes, and that I will continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_26" data-id="PP1_26">As a result, you should be proud of me in Christ Jesus when I am present with you again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_27" data-id="PP1_27">Only conduct your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that, whether I come to see you or I am absent, I may hear about how you stand firmly in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_28" data-id="PP1_28">And do not be frightened by anything from those opposing you, which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_29" data-id="PP1_29">Because to you it has been granted, for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP1_30" data-id="PP1_30">since you have to suffer the same conflict you saw in me, and now you have heard that it is in me.</span>

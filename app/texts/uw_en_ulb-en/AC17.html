<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_1" data-id="AC17_1">Now when they had passed through the cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to the city of Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_2" data-id="AC17_2">Paul, as his custom was, went to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the scriptures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_3" data-id="AC17_3">He was opening the scriptures and explaining that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from the dead. He said, "This Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_4" data-id="AC17_4">Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas,  including the devout Greeks, many of the leading women  and a great crowd.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_5" data-id="AC17_5">But the unbelieving Jews, being moved with jealousy, took certain wicked men from the marketplace, gathered a crowd together, and set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they wanted to bring Paul and Silas out to the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_6" data-id="AC17_6">But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and certain other brothers before the officials of the city, crying, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_7" data-id="AC17_7">These men whom Jason has welcomed act against the decrees of Caesar; they say that there is another kingâ€”Jesus."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_8" data-id="AC17_8">When the crowd and the officials of the city heard these things, they were troubled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_9" data-id="AC17_9">After they had taken financial security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_10" data-id="AC17_10">That night the brothers sent Paul and Silas to Berea.  When they arrived there, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_11" data-id="AC17_11">Now these people were of a higher mind than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_12" data-id="AC17_12">Therefore many of them believed, including some influential Greek women and many men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_13" data-id="AC17_13">But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was also proclaiming the word of God at Berea, they went there and stirred up and troubled the crowds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_14" data-id="AC17_14">Then immediately, the brothers sent Paul to go to the sea, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_15" data-id="AC17_15">Those who were leading Paul took him as far as the city of  Athens. As they left Paul there, they received from him instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_16" data-id="AC17_16">Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_17" data-id="AC17_17">So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshipped God and  also with those he met  every day in the marketplace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_18" data-id="AC17_18">But also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of strange gods," because he was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_19" data-id="AC17_19">They took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know this new teaching which you were speaking?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_20" data-id="AC17_20">For you bring some strange things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know what these things mean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_21" data-id="AC17_21">(Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent their time in nothing but either telling or listening about something new.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_22" data-id="AC17_22">So Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v AC17_22" data-id="AC17_22">"You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_23" data-id="AC17_23">For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_24" data-id="AC17_24">The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples built with hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_25" data-id="AC17_25">Neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives people life and breath and everything else.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_26" data-id="AC17_26">And from one man he made every nation of people living on the surface of the earth, having determined their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their living areas.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_27" data-id="AC17_27">Therefore, they should seek God and perhaps they might reach out to him and find him, and indeed, he is not far from any one of us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_28" data-id="AC17_28">For in him we live and move and have our being, just as one of your own poets has said,</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v AC17_28" data-id="AC17_28">'For we also are his offspring.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_29" data-id="AC17_29">Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divinity is like gold, or silver, or stones, sculptured with the art and thought of man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_30" data-id="AC17_30">Therefore God overlooked the times of ignorance, but now he commands  all men everywhere to repent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_31" data-id="AC17_31">This is because he has set a day when he will judge the world in righteousness by the man he has chosen.  God  has given proof of this man to everyone by raising him from the dead."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_32" data-id="AC17_32">Now when the men of Athens heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked Paul; but others said, "We will listen to you again about this matter."</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_33" data-id="AC17_33">After that, Paul left them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC17_34" data-id="AC17_34">But certain men joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_1" data-id="EX18_1">Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people. He heard that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_2" data-id="EX18_2">Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her home,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_3" data-id="EX18_3">and her two sons; the name of the one son was Gershom, for Moses had said, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign land."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_4" data-id="EX18_4">The name of the other was Eliezer, for Moses had said, "My ancestor's God was my help. He rescued me from Pharaoh's sword."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_5" data-id="EX18_5">Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with Moses' sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was camped at the mountain of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_6" data-id="EX18_6">He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_7" data-id="EX18_7">Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. They asked about each other's welfare and then went into the tent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_8" data-id="EX18_8">Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake,  about all the hardships that had come to them along the way, and how Yahweh had rescued them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_9" data-id="EX18_9">Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Yahweh had done for Israel, in that he had rescued them from the Egyptians' power.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_10" data-id="EX18_10">Jethro said, "May Yahweh be praised, for he has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh's power, and he has set the people free from their  control.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_11" data-id="EX18_11">Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods, because when the Egyptians treated the Israelites arrogantly, God rescued his people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_12" data-id="EX18_12">Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to eat a meal before God with Moses' father-in-law.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_13" data-id="EX18_13">On the next day Moses sat down to judge the people. The people stood around him from morning until evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_14" data-id="EX18_14">When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing with the people? Why is it that you sit alone and all the people stand about you from morning until evening?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_15" data-id="EX18_15">Moses said to his father-in-law, "The people come to me to ask for God's direction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_16" data-id="EX18_16">When they have a dispute, they come to me. I decide between one person and another, and I teach them God's statutes and laws."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_17" data-id="EX18_17">Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not very good.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_18" data-id="EX18_18">You will certainly wear out yourself and the people who come to you, because the burden is too heavy for you. You cannot do it yourself alone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_19" data-id="EX18_19">Listen to me. I will give you advice, and God will be with you, because you are the people's  representative to God, and you bring their disputes to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_20" data-id="EX18_20">You must teach them his statutes and laws. You must show them the way to walk and the work to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_21" data-id="EX18_21">Furthermore, you must choose capable men from all the people, men who honor God, men of truth who hate unjust gain. You must put them over people, to be leaders in charge of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and of tens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_22" data-id="EX18_22">They will judge the people in all routine cases, but the difficult cases they will bring to you. As for all the small cases, they can judge those themselves. In that way it will be easier for you, and they will carry the burden with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_23" data-id="EX18_23">If you do this, and if God commands you to do so, then you will be able to endure, and the entire people will be able to go home satisfied."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_24" data-id="EX18_24">So Moses listened to his father-in-law's words and did everything that he had said.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_25" data-id="EX18_25">Moses chose capable men from all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders in charge of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_26" data-id="EX18_26">They judged the people in normal circumstances. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but they themselves judged all the small cases.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX18_27" data-id="EX18_27">Then Moses let his father-in-law leave, and Jethro went back into his own land.</span>

<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_38" data-id="MK10_38">But Jesus replied to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup which I will drink or endure the baptism with which I will be baptized?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_39" data-id="MK10_39">They said to him, "We are able." Jesus said to them, "The cup that I will drink, you will drink. And the baptism with which I am baptized, you will endure.</span>

<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_47" data-id="MK10_47">When he heard that Jesus the Nazarene was on his way, he began to shout and to say, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span>

<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_51" data-id="MK10_51">Jesus answered him and said, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to receive my sight."</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK10_52" data-id="MK10_52">Jesus said, "Go. Your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight, and followed him along the road as he walked on.</span>

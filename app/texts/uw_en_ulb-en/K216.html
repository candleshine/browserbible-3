<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_2" data-id="K216_2">Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, as David his ancestor had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_3" data-id="K216_3">Instead, he walked in the way of the kings of Israel; indeed, he put his son in the fire as a burnt offering, following the detestable practices of the nations, which Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_8" data-id="K216_8">So Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh and among the treasures of the king's palace and he sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_10" data-id="K216_10">King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria. At Damascus he saw an altar. He sent to Uriah the priest a model of the altar and its pattern and the design for all the workmanship needed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_11" data-id="K216_11">So Uriah the priest built an altar to be just like the plans that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus. He finished it before King Ahaz arrived back from Damascus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_12" data-id="K216_12">When the king came from Damascus he saw the altar; the king approached the altar and made offerings on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_13" data-id="K216_13">He made his burnt offering and his grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and splashed the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_14" data-id="K216_14">The bronze altar that was before Yahwehâ€”he brought it from the front of the temple, from between his altar and the temple of Yahweh and put it on the north side of his altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_15" data-id="K216_15">Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying, "On the large altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, and the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offerings. Splash on it all the blood of the burnt  offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice. But the bronze altar will be for me to ask for God's help."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K216_16" data-id="K216_16">Uriah the priest did just what King Ahaz commanded.</span>

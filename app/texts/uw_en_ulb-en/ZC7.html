</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC7_4" data-id="ZC7_4">So the word of Yahweh of hosts came to me and said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC7_6" data-id="ZC7_6">And when you ate and drank, did you not eat and drink for yourselves?</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC7_12" data-id="ZC7_12">They made their hearts as hard as rock so they would not hear the law or the words  of Yahweh of hosts. He had sent these messages to the people by his Spirit in earlier times, by the mouth of the prophets. But the people refused to listen, so Yahweh of hosts was very angry with them.</span>

For no one will pass through the land  or return to it since the people have made their delightful land into a wasteland.'"</span>

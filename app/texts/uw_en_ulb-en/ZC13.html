<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_4" data-id="ZC13_4">Then it will happen on that day that each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he is about to prophesy. These prophets will no longer wear a hairy cloak, in order to deceive the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC13_5" data-id="ZC13_5">For each will say, 'I am not a prophet! I am a man who works the soil, for the land became my work while I was still a young man!'</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_1" data-id="EX34_1">Yahweh said to Moses, "Cut two tablets of stone like the first tablets. I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets, the tablets that you broke.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_2" data-id="EX34_2">Be ready by morning and come up Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the mountain top.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_3" data-id="EX34_3">No one is to come up with you. Do not let anyone else be seen anywhere on  the mountain. No flocks or herds are even to graze in front of the mountain."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_4" data-id="EX34_4">So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and he got up early in the morning and went up Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had instructed him. Moses carried the tablets of stone in his hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_5" data-id="EX34_5">Yahweh came down in the cloud and stood with Moses there, and he pronounced the name "Yahweh."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_6" data-id="EX34_6">Yahweh passed by before him and proclaimed, "Yahweh, Yahweh, God is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in covenant faithfulness and trustworthiness,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_7" data-id="EX34_7">keeping covenant faithfulness for thousands of generations, forgiving iniquities, transgressions, and sins. But he will by no means clear the guilty. He will bring the punishment for the fathers' sin on their children and on their children's children, as far as the third and fourth generations."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_8" data-id="EX34_8">Moses quickly bowed his head to the ground and worshiped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_9" data-id="EX34_9">Then he said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, my Lord, please go among us, for this people is stubborn. Pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_10" data-id="EX34_10">Yahweh said, "See, I am about to make a covenant. Before all your people, I will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation. All the people among you will see my deeds, for it is a fearful thing that I am doing with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_11" data-id="EX34_11">Obey what I command you today. I am about to drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_12" data-id="EX34_12">Be careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, or they will become a trap among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_13" data-id="EX34_13">Instead, you must break down their altars, smash their sacred stone pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_14" data-id="EX34_14">For you must worship no other god, for I, Yahweh, whose name is 'Jealous,' am a jealous God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_15" data-id="EX34_15">Do not make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land. They commit adultery and go after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and they will invite you and you eat some of their sacrifices.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_16" data-id="EX34_16">If so, you will even take some of their daughters for your sons, and their daughters will commit adultery and go after their own gods, and they will make your sons commit adultery and go after their gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_17" data-id="EX34_17">You must mold no idols for yourselves.</span>

As I commanded you, you must eat bread without yeast for seven days at the fixed time in the month of Abib, for it was in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_19" data-id="EX34_19">All the firstborn are mine, even every male firstborn of your cattle, both of  oxen and sheep.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_20" data-id="EX34_20">You must buy back the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb, but if you do not buy it back, then you must break its neck. You must buy back all the firstborn of your sons. No one may appear before me empty-handed.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_21" data-id="EX34_21">You may work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest. Even at plowing time and in harvest, you must rest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_22" data-id="EX34_22">You must observe the Festival of Weeks with the first yield of the wheat harvest, and you must observe the Festival of Ingathering at the year's end.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_25" data-id="EX34_25">You must not offer the blood of my sacrifice with any yeast, nor may any meat from the sacrifice at the Festival of the Passover be left over to the morning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_26" data-id="EX34_26">You must bring the best of the first fruits from your fields to my house. You must not boil a young goat in its mother's milk."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_27" data-id="EX34_27">Yahweh said to Moses, "Write down these words, for I pledge myself to these words I have spoken, and have made a covenant with you and Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_28" data-id="EX34_28">Moses was there with Yahweh for forty days and nights; he did not eat any food nor drink any water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_29" data-id="EX34_29">When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant decrees in his hand, he did not know that the skin of his face had become radiant while speaking with God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_30" data-id="EX34_30">When Aaron and the  Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_31" data-id="EX34_31">But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community came up to him. Then Moses spoke with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_32" data-id="EX34_32">After this, all the people of Israel came up to Moses, and he told them all the commands that Yahweh had  given him on Mount Sinai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_33" data-id="EX34_33">When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_34" data-id="EX34_34">Whenever Moses went before Yahweh to speak with him, he would remove the veil. Then he would put the veil back on when he came away. He would come out of the tent and tell the Israelites what he had been instructed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v EX34_35" data-id="EX34_35">The Israelites saw Moses' face shining. But then he would put the veil over his face again until he went back in to speak with Yahweh.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_1" data-id="R232_1">After these things and these acts of faithfulness, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came and entered Judah; he camped to attack the fortified cities, which he intended to capture for himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_2" data-id="R232_2">When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to fight against Jerusalem,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_3" data-id="R232_3">he consulted with his leaders and his powerful men to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; they helped him do so.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_4" data-id="R232_4">So many people gathered together and stopped up all the springs and the stream that was flowing through the middle of the land. They said, "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find a lot of water?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_5" data-id="R232_5">Hezekiah took courage and built up all the wall that was broken down; he raised it up to the towers, and also the other wall outside. He also strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made large amounts of weapons and shields.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_6" data-id="R232_6">He placed military commanders over the people. He gathered them together to him in the broad place at the city gate and spoke encouragingly to them. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_7" data-id="R232_7">"Be strong and of good courage. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and all the army  that is with him, for someone is with us who is greater than those with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_8" data-id="R232_8">With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is Yahweh, our God, to help us, and to fight our battles." Then the people comforted themselves with the words of Hezekiah, king of Judah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_9" data-id="R232_9">After this, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (now he was in front of Lachish, and all his army was with him), to Hezekiah, king of Judah, and to all of Judah who were in Jerusalem. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_10" data-id="R232_10">"This is what Sennacherib, king of Assyria, says: 'What are you relying on in order to endure a siege in Jerusalem?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_11" data-id="R232_11">Is not Hezekiah misleading you, that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst, when he tells you, "Yahweh our God will rescue us from the hand of the king of Assyria"?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_12" data-id="R232_12">Has not this same Hezekiah  taken away his shrines and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, "On one altar you will worship, and on it you will burn your sacrifices?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_13" data-id="R232_13">Do you not know what I and my ancestors have done to all the people groups of other lands? Were the gods of the people groups of the lands able in any way to rescue their land from my power?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_14" data-id="R232_14">Among all the gods of those nations that my ancestors completely destroyed, was there any god who could rescue his people out of my hand? Why should your God be able to rescue you from my power?</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_15" data-id="R232_15">Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you or persuade you in this way. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to rescue his people out of my hand, or out of the hand of my ancestors. How much less will your God rescue you from my hand?'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_16" data-id="R232_16">Sennacherib's servants spoke even more against Yahweh God and against his servant Hezekiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_17" data-id="R232_17">Sennacherib also wrote letters in order to mock Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him. He said, "As the gods of the nations of the lands have not rescued their people out of my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not rescue his people out of my hand."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_18" data-id="R232_18">They cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and trouble them, so that they might capture the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_19" data-id="R232_19">They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they had spoken of the gods of the other peoples of the earth, which are merely the work of men's hands.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_20" data-id="R232_20">Hezekiah, the king, and Isaiah, the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed because of this matter and cried out to heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_21" data-id="R232_21">Yahweh sent an angel, who killed the fighting men, the commanders, and the officers of the king in the camp. So Sennacherib  returned shame-faced to his own land. When he had gone into the house of his god, some of his own children killed him there with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_22" data-id="R232_22">In this way, Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them in every way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_23" data-id="R232_23">Many brought gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah, king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from that time forward.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_24" data-id="R232_24">In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of dying. He prayed to Yahweh, who spoke to him and gave him a sign that he would be healed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_25" data-id="R232_25">But Hezekiah did not pay back Yahweh for the help given to him, for his heart was lifted up. So anger came on him, and on Judah and Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_26" data-id="R232_26">Nevertheless, Hezekiah later humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that Yahweh's anger did not come on them during Hezekiah's days. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_27" data-id="R232_27">Hezekiah had very many riches and much honor. He provided himself with storerooms for silver, gold, precious stones, and for spices, as well as for shields and for all kinds of valuable objects.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_28" data-id="R232_28">He also had storehouses for the harvest of grain, new wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of animals; he also had flocks in their pens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_29" data-id="R232_29">In addition, he provided himself with cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very much wealth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_30" data-id="R232_30">It was this same Hezekiah who also stopped up the upper spring of the waters of Gihon, and who brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David. Hezekiah succeeded in all his projects.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_31" data-id="R232_31">However, in the matter of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent to him to ask questions of those who knew, about the miraculous sign that had been done in the land, God left him to himself, in order to test him, and to know all that was in his heart.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_32" data-id="R232_32">As for the other matters concerning Hezekiah, including his actions of covenant loyalty, you can see that they are written in The Vision of Isaiah the Prophet, (the son of Amoz), and in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v R232_33" data-id="R232_33">Hezekiah slept with his ancestors, and they buried him on the hill of the tombs of the descendants of David. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death.  Manasseh his son became king in his place.</span>

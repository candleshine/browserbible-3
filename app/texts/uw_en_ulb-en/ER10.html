<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_2" data-id="ER10_2">Shekaniah son of Jehiel of the descendants of Elam said to Ezra, "We ourselves have committed treason against our God and have lived with foreign women from the people of the other lands. But now there is hope for Israel concerning this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_3" data-id="ER10_3">So now let us make a covenant with our God to send out all the women and their children according to the Lord's instructions and the instructions of those who tremble at the commands of our God, and let it be done according to the law.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_5" data-id="ER10_5">So Ezra rose and made the priestly officials, the Levites, and all of Israel promise to act in this way. They promised.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_6" data-id="ER10_6">Then Ezra rose from before God's house and went to the rooms of Jehochanan son of Eliashib. He did not eat any bread or drink any water, since he was mourning concerning the faithlessness of those who had been in captivity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_7" data-id="ER10_7">So they sent word in Judah and Jerusalem to all the people back from exile to assemble in Jerusalem.</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_13" data-id="ER10_13">However, there are many people, and it is the rainy season. We have no strength to stand outside, and this is not only one or two days of work, since we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ER10_14" data-id="ER10_14">So let our officials represent all the assembly. Let all who have allowed foreign women to live in our cities come at the time that will be fixed with the city elders and the city judges until the raging wrath of our God goes away from us."</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_11" data-id="DT20_11">If they accept your offer and open their gates to you, all the people who are found in it must become forced labor for you and must serve you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_12" data-id="DT20_12">But if it makes no offer of peace to you, but instead makes war against you, then you must besiege it,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_13" data-id="DT20_13">and when Yahweh your God gives you victory and puts them under your control, you must kill every man in the town.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_15" data-id="DT20_15">You must act in this way toward all the cities that are very far from you, cities that are not of the cities of these following nations.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_17" data-id="DT20_17">Instead, you must completely destroy them: the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as Yahweh your God has commanded you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_18" data-id="DT20_18">Do this so that they do not teach you to act in any of their disgusting ways, as they have done with their gods. If you do, you will sin against Yahweh your God. </span>

<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_19" data-id="DT20_19">When you will besiege a city for a long time, as you wage war against it to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by wielding an ax against them. For you may eat from them, so you must not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man whom you should besiege?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT20_20" data-id="DT20_20">Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you may destroy and cut down; you will build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls.</span>

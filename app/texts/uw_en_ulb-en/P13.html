<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_1" data-id="P13_1">In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands, so that, even if some are disobedient to the word, through their wives' behavior they may be won without a word, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_2" data-id="P13_2">because they will have seen your pure behavior with honor for themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_3" data-id="P13_3">Let it not be done with outward ornaments—braided hair, jewels of gold, or fashionable clothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_4" data-id="P13_4">But let it be done instead with the inner person of the heart, and the lasting beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_5" data-id="P13_5">For holy women once adorned themselves in this way. They had confidence in God and they submitted to their own husbands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_6" data-id="P13_6">In this way Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You are now her children if you do what is good and if you are not afraid of trouble.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_7" data-id="P13_7">In the same way, you husbands should live with your wives according to knowledge as the weaker female partner, recognizing them as fellow recipients of the gift of life. Do this so that your prayers are not hindered.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_8" data-id="P13_8">Finally, all of you, be likeminded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, and humble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_9" data-id="P13_9">Do not pay back evil for evil or insult for insult; on the contrary, continue to bless, because for this you were called, that you might inherit a blessing.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_10" data-id="P13_10">"The one who wants to love life and to see good days should stop his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_11" data-id="P13_11">Let him turn away from what is bad and do what is good. Let him seek peace and pursue it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_12" data-id="P13_12">The eyes of the Lord see the righteous, and his ears hear their requests. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_13" data-id="P13_13">Who is he who will harm you, if you desire what is good?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_14" data-id="P13_14">But if you do suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_15" data-id="P13_15">Instead, set apart the Lord Christ in your hearts as holy. Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you why you have confidence in God. Do this with meekness and respect.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_16" data-id="P13_16">Have a good conscience so that the people who insult your good life in Christ may be ashamed because they are speaking against you as if you were evildoers. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_17" data-id="P13_17">It is better, if God desires, that you suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_18" data-id="P13_18">Christ also suffered once for sins. He who is righteous suffered for us, who were unrighteous, so that he would bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but he was made alive in the spirit.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_19" data-id="P13_19">In the spirit, he went and preached to the spirits who are now in prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_20" data-id="P13_20">They were disobedient when the patience of God was waiting in the days of Noah, in the days of the building of an ark, and God saved a few people—eight souls—through the water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_21" data-id="P13_21">This is a symbol of the baptism that saves you now, not as a washing away of dirt from the body, but as the appeal of a good conscience to God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v P13_22" data-id="P13_22">He is at the right hand of God. He went into heaven. Angels, authorities, and powers must submit to him.</span>

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_3" data-id="TT2_3">Older women likewise should always present themselves as reverent, not gossips. They should not need to continually drink wine. They should teach what is good</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT2_4" data-id="TT2_4">in order to call the younger women to be balanced in their thinking, to encourage them to love their own husbands and children, to be sensible,</span>

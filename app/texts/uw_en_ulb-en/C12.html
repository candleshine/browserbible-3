<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_1" data-id="C12_1">When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with eloquence of speech or wisdom as I proclaimed hidden truths about God. </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_2" data-id="C12_2">For I decided to know nothing when I was among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_3" data-id="C12_3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_4" data-id="C12_4">And my message and my proclamation were not with persuasive words of wisdom. Instead, they were with the demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_5" data-id="C12_5">so that your faith might not be in the wisdom of humans, but in the power of God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_6" data-id="C12_6">Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this world, or of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_7" data-id="C12_7">Instead, we speak God's wisdom in hidden truth, the hidden wisdom that God predestined before the ages for our glory.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_8" data-id="C12_8">None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, for if they had understood it at that time, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_11" data-id="C12_11">For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the person in him? So also, no one knows the deep things of God except the Spirit of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_12" data-id="C12_12">But we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we might know the things freely given to us by God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_13" data-id="C12_13">We speak about these things in words that man's wisdom cannot teach, but which the Spirit teaches us. The Spirit interprets spiritual words with spiritual wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_14" data-id="C12_14">The unspiritual person does not receive the things that belong to the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. He cannot know them because they are spiritually discerned.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C12_15" data-id="C12_15">The one who is spiritual judges all things, but he is not subject to the judgment of others.</span>

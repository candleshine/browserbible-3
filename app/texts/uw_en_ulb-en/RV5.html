<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_1" data-id="RV5_1">Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne, a scroll written on the front side and the back side, and it had been sealed with seven seals.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_2" data-id="RV5_2">I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_3" data-id="RV5_3">No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to read it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_4" data-id="RV5_4">I wept bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to read it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_5" data-id="RV5_5">But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Look! The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, and he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_6" data-id="RV5_6">Between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, looking as though he had been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes—these are the seven Spirits of God sent out over all the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_7" data-id="RV5_7">He went and took hold of the scroll out of the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_8" data-id="RV5_8">When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders laid themselves on the ground before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, which is the prayers of the saints.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">They sang a new song:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">"You are worthy to take the scroll </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">and to open its seals. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">For you were slaughtered, and with your blood you purchased persons for God </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v RV5_9" data-id="RV5_9">from every tribe, language, people, and nation.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">You made them a kingdom and priests to serve our God, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v RV5_10" data-id="RV5_10">and they will reign on the earth."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_11" data-id="RV5_11">Then I looked and heard the sound of many angels around the throne—the number of them was 200,000,000—and the living creatures and the elders.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">They said in a loud voice,</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v RV5_12" data-id="RV5_12">"Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise."</span>
</div>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">I heard every created thing that was in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea—everything in them—saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="pi">
<span class="v RV5_13" data-id="RV5_13">"To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb, be praise, honor, glory, and the power to rule, forever and ever."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV5_14" data-id="RV5_14">The four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders lay down and worshiped.</span>

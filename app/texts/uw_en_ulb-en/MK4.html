<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_1" data-id="MK4_1">Again he began to teach beside the lake. A very large crowd gathered around him, so he got into a boat and pushed into the lake, and he sat in it. All the crowd was beside the water on the shore.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_2" data-id="MK4_2">He taught them many things in parables, and as he taught, he said to them:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_3" data-id="MK4_3">"Listen, the sower went out to sow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_4" data-id="MK4_4">As he sowed, some seeds fell on the road, and the birds came and devoured them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_5" data-id="MK4_5">Other seeds fell on the rocky ground, where they did not have much soil. Immediately they sprang up, because the soil had no depth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_6" data-id="MK4_6">But when the sun had risen, they were scorched because they had no root, and they withered away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_7" data-id="MK4_7">Other seeds fell among the thorn plants. The thorn plants grew up and choked them. That seed yielded no grain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_8" data-id="MK4_8">Other seeds fell into the good soil and produced grain as it sprouted and grew up. That seed yielded some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was planted."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_9" data-id="MK4_9">He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_10" data-id="MK4_10">When Jesus was alone, those who were close to him and with the Twelve asked him about the parables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_11" data-id="MK4_11">He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God. But to those outside everything is in parables,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">so that when they look, yes they look, but do not see, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">and so that when they hear, yes they hear, but do not understand, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK4_12" data-id="MK4_12">or else they would turn and God would forgive them."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_13" data-id="MK4_13">He said, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand the rest of the parables?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_14" data-id="MK4_14">The sower sows the word.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_15" data-id="MK4_15">These are the ones that fall beside the road, where the word was sown. When they have heard it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_16" data-id="MK4_16">These are the ones sown on the rocky ground, who, when they heard the word, immediately receive it with joy;</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_17" data-id="MK4_17">They have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word,  they stumble immediately.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_18" data-id="MK4_18">Others are the ones sown among the thorn plants. These heard the word,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_19" data-id="MK4_19">but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things, entered in and choked the word, and it became unfruitful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_20" data-id="MK4_20">Those that were sown on the good soil, they are the ones who heard the word and received it and it produced fruit, some thirty, and some sixty, and some a hundred times what was planted."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_21" data-id="MK4_21">Jesus said to them, "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed? You bring it in and you put it on a lampstand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_22" data-id="MK4_22">For nothing is hidden, that will not be known, nor anything in secret, that will not come into the light.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_23" data-id="MK4_23">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_24" data-id="MK4_24">He said to them, "Pay attention to what you hear, for the measure you use, is the measure you will receive; and even more you will get.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_25" data-id="MK4_25">Because whoever has, to him will be given more, and whoever has not, from him will be taken away even what he has."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_26" data-id="MK4_26">Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is like a man who sows his seed on the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_27" data-id="MK4_27">He sleeps and gets up, night and day; and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_28" data-id="MK4_28">The earth bears grain by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the mature grain in the ear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_29" data-id="MK4_29">But when the grain is ripe, immediately he puts out the sickle because the harvest has come."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_30" data-id="MK4_30">He said, "To what can we compare the kingdom of God and what parable can we use to explain it?</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_31" data-id="MK4_31">It is like a mustard seed, which when it is sown it is the smallest of all the seeds sown that lay upon the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_32" data-id="MK4_32">Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all the garden plants. It puts out great branches, so even the birds of heaven can make their nests under its shade."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_33" data-id="MK4_33">With many parables like this he spoke the word to them, as much as they were able to hear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_34" data-id="MK4_34">But he did not speak to them without a parable. But in private he explained everything to his own disciples.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_35" data-id="MK4_35">On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go over to the other side."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_36" data-id="MK4_36">So they left the crowd. The disciples took Jesus along with them, since he was already in the boat. Other boats were with him also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_37" data-id="MK4_37">There began a violent storm with wind, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was about to be full of water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_38" data-id="MK4_38">But Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke him up, saying, "Teacher, do you not care that we are about to die?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_39" data-id="MK4_39">He awoke, rebuked the wind. and said to the sea, "Peace, be still." And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_40" data-id="MK4_40">He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK4_41" data-id="MK4_41">They were filled with great fear and they said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</span>

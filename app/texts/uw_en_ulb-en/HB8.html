<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_1" data-id="HB8_1">Now the point of what we are saying is this: we have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_2" data-id="HB8_2">He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord set up, not any mortal person.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_3" data-id="HB8_3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary to have something to offer.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_4" data-id="HB8_4">Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are already those who offer the gifts according to the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_5" data-id="HB8_5">They serve something that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to construct the tabernacle: "See," God said, "that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_6" data-id="HB8_6">But now Christ has received a superior ministry because he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_7" data-id="HB8_7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then there would have  been no need to seek a second covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">For when God found fault with the people, he said,</span>

<span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">" 'See, the days are coming,' says the Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_8" data-id="HB8_8">'when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors</span>

<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">on the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">For they did not continue in my covenant,</span>

<span class="v HB8_9" data-id="HB8_9">and I paid no more attention to them,' says the Lord.</span>

<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_3" data-id="T21_3">I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience, as I constantly remember you in my prayers, night and day</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_4" data-id="T21_4">longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_5" data-id="T21_5">having been reminded of your genuine faith,  which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and which I am convinced lives in you also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_6" data-id="T21_6">This is the reason I remind you to rekindle the gift of God in you through the laying on of my hands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_7" data-id="T21_7">For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_8" data-id="T21_8">Then do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, Paul, his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_9" data-id="T21_9">who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own plan and grace, which He gave to us in Christ Jesus before times ever began;</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_10" data-id="T21_10">but now God's salvation has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who destroyed death, and brought life that never ends to light through the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_11" data-id="T21_11">Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_12" data-id="T21_12">For this cause I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed. For I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him until that day.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T21_13" data-id="T21_13">Keep to the pattern of faithful instruction which you heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_1" data-id="JG4_1">After Ehud died, the people of Israel disobeyed Yahweh again, by doing evil things, and he saw what they did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_2" data-id="JG4_2">Yahweh handed them over to the power of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was named Sisera, and he lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_3" data-id="JG4_3">The people of Israel called out to Yahweh for help, because Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots and he oppressed the people of Israel with force for twenty years.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_4" data-id="JG4_4">Now Deborah, a prophetess (the wife of Lappidoth), was a leading judge in Israel at that time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_5" data-id="JG4_5">She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came to her to settle their disputes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_6" data-id="JG4_6">She sent for Barak (the son of Abinoam) from Kedesh in Naphtali. She said to him, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, commands you, 'Go to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_7" data-id="JG4_7">I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon, with his chariots and his army, and I will give you victory over him.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_8" data-id="JG4_8">Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go, but if you do not go with me, I will not go."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_9" data-id="JG4_9">She said, "I will certainly go with you. However, the road on which you are going will not lead to your honor, for Yahweh will make a woman defeat Sisera by her strength." Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_10" data-id="JG4_10">Barak called for the men of Zebulun and Naphtali to come together at Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah went along with him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_11" data-id="JG4_11">Now Heber (the Kenite) had separated himself from the Kenites—they were the descendants of Hobab (Moses' father-in-law)—and he pitched his tent by the oak in Zaanannim near Kedesh.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_12" data-id="JG4_12">When they told Sisera that Barak (the son of Abinoam) had gone up to Mount Tabor,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_13" data-id="JG4_13">Sisera called out all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the soldiers who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles to the Kishon River.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_14" data-id="JG4_14">Deborah said to Barak, "Go! For this is the day in which Yahweh has given you victory over Sisera. Is not Yahweh leading you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_15" data-id="JG4_15">Yahweh made Sisera's army confused, all his chariots, and all his army, and Barak's men attacked them, and Sisera got down from his chariot and ran away on foot.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_16" data-id="JG4_16">But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles, and the whole army of Sisera was killed by the edge of the sword, and not a man survived.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_17" data-id="JG4_17">But Sisera ran away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_18" data-id="JG4_18">Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Turn aside, my master; turn aside to me and do not be afraid." So he turned aside to her and came into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_19" data-id="JG4_19">He said to her, "Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." She opened a leather bag of milk and gave him drink, and then she covered him up again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_20" data-id="JG4_20">He said to her, "Stand at the opening of the tent. If someone comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?', say 'No'."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_21" data-id="JG4_21">Then Jael (the wife of Heber) took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand and went in secretly to him, for he was in a deep sleep, and she hammered the tent peg into the side of his head and it pierced through him and went down into the ground. And so he died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_22" data-id="JG4_22">As Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael want out to meet him and said to him, "Come, I will show you the man you are looking for." So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in the side of his head.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_23" data-id="JG4_23">So on that day God defeated Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JG4_24" data-id="JG4_24">The might of the people of Israel grew stronger and stronger against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed him.</span>

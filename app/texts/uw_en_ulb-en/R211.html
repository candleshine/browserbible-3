<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R211_2" data-id="R211_2">But the word of Yahweh came to Shemaiah, the man of God; it said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R211_14" data-id="R211_14">For the Levites left their pasturelands and property in order to come to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons had driven them away, so that they could no longer perform priestly duties for Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v R211_15" data-id="R211_15">Jeroboam appointed for himself priests for the shrines and the idols of calves and goats that he had made.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_1" data-id="C113_1">Suppose that I speak with the tongues of men and of angels. But if I do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_2" data-id="C113_2">Suppose that I have the gift of prophecy and understand all hidden truths and knowledge, and that I have all faith so as to remove mountains. But if I do not have love, I am nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_3" data-id="C113_3">And suppose that I give all I own to feed the poor, and that I give my body to be burned. But if I do not have love, I gain nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_4" data-id="C113_4">Love is patient and kind. Love does not envy or boast. It is not arrogant</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_5" data-id="C113_5">or rude. It is not self-serving. It is not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_6" data-id="C113_6">It does not rejoice in unrighteousness. Instead, it rejoices in the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_7" data-id="C113_7">Love bears all things, believes all things, has confidence concerning all things, and endures all things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_8" data-id="C113_8">Love never ends. If there are prophecies, they will pass away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will pass away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_9" data-id="C113_9">For we know in part and we prophesy in part.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_10" data-id="C113_10">But when the perfect comes, that which is incomplete will pass away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_11" data-id="C113_11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child. When I became an adult, I put away childish things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_12" data-id="C113_12">For now we see in a mirror, as in a dark image, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I have been fully known.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C113_13" data-id="C113_13">But now these three remain: faith, future confidence, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v R226_16" data-id="R226_16">But when Uzziah had become powerful, his heart was lifted up so that he acted corruptly; he trespassed against Yahweh, his God, for he went into the house of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v R226_17" data-id="R226_17">Azariah, the priest, went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were courageous men.</span>

Go out of the holy place, for you have trespassed. There will be no honor for you in this from Yahweh God."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v R226_19" data-id="R226_19">Then Uzziah became angry. He was holding a censer in his hand to burn incense.

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_1" data-id="GN50_1">Then Joseph hugged his father's face, wept over him, and kissed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_2" data-id="GN50_2">Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_3" data-id="GN50_3">They took forty days, for that was the full time  for embalming. The Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_4" data-id="GN50_4">When the days of weeping were over, Joseph spoke to  Pharaoh's royal court saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_5" data-id="GN50_5">'My father made me swear, saying, "See, I am about to die. Bury me in my tomb that I dug  for myself in the land of Canaan. There you will bury me." Now let me go up and bury my father, and then I will return.'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_6" data-id="GN50_6">Pharaoh answered, "Go and bury your father, as he made you swear."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_7" data-id="GN50_7">Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the officials of Pharaoh, the courtiers of his household, and all the senior officials of the land of Egypt,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_8" data-id="GN50_8">with all Joseph's household and his brothers, and his father's household. But  they left their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, in the land of Goshen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_9" data-id="GN50_9">Chariots and horsemen also went with him. It was a very large group of people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_10" data-id="GN50_10">When they came to the threshing floor of Atad on the other side of  the Jordan, they mourned with very great and grievous sorrow. There Joseph made a seven day mourning for his father.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_11" data-id="GN50_11">When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a very sad occasion for the Egyptians."  That is why the place was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_12" data-id="GN50_12">So his sons did for Jacob just as he had instructed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_13" data-id="GN50_13">His sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. Abraham had bought the cave with the field for a burial place. He had bought it from Ephron the Hittite.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_14" data-id="GN50_14">After he had buried his father, Joseph returned into Egypt, he, along with his brothers, and all who had accompanied him to bury his father.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_15" data-id="GN50_15">When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph bears a grudge and wants to repay us in full for all the evil that we did to him?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_16" data-id="GN50_16">So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave instructions before he died, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_17" data-id="GN50_17">'Tell  Joseph this, "Please forgive your brothers and the wrong they committed when they treated you so badly."' Now please forgive  the servants of the God of your father."  Joseph wept when the message was brought to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_18" data-id="GN50_18">His brothers also went and lay facedown before him. They said, "See, we are your servants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_19" data-id="GN50_19">But Joseph answered them, "Do not be afraid. Am I in the place of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_20" data-id="GN50_20">And as for you, you meant to harm me, but God meant it for good, to preserve the lives of many people, as you see today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_21" data-id="GN50_21">So now do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little children." He comforted them in this way and spoke kindly to them.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_22" data-id="GN50_22">Joseph lived in Egypt, together with his father's family. He lived one hundred ten years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_23" data-id="GN50_23">Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation. He also saw the children of Machir son of Manasseh. They were "born on his knees." </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_24" data-id="GN50_24">Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die; but God will  surely come to you and lead you up out of this land to the land which he swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_25" data-id="GN50_25">Then Joseph made the people of Israel swear an oath. He said, "God will surely come to you. At that time you must carry up my bones from here."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v GN50_26" data-id="GN50_26">So Joseph died, one hundred ten years old. After they embalmed him, they put  him in a coffin in Egypt.</span>

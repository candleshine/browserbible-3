<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_2" data-id="AC3_2">A certain man, lame from birth, was carried every day and was laid at the door of the temple called Beautiful, so he could beg for alms from  the people who went into the temple.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_3" data-id="AC3_3">When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked for alms.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_4" data-id="AC3_4">Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John, said, "Look at us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_5" data-id="AC3_5">The lame man looked at them, expecting to receive something from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_6" data-id="AC3_6">But Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have, I will give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_7" data-id="AC3_7">Peter took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_8" data-id="AC3_8">Leaping up, the lame man stood and began to walk; and he entered with Peter and John into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_11" data-id="AC3_11">As he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly marveling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_12" data-id="AC3_12">When Peter saw this, he answered the people, "You men of Israel, why do you marvel? Why do you  fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_13" data-id="AC3_13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus.

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_14" data-id="AC3_14">You rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and you asked instead for a murderer to be released to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_15" data-id="AC3_15">You killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; and we are witnesses of this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_16" data-id="AC3_16">Now faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, his faith which is in Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_17" data-id="AC3_17">Now, brothers, I know that  you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_18" data-id="AC3_18">But the things which God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he has now fulfilled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_19" data-id="AC3_19">Repent, therefore, and turn, so that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come periods of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_20" data-id="AC3_20">and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for you, Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_21" data-id="AC3_21">He is the One whom the heavens must receive and keep until the time of the restoration of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been ever since ancient times.</span>

<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_25" data-id="AC3_25">You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, as he said to Abraham, 'In your seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC3_26" data-id="AC3_26">After God raised up his servant, he sent him to you first, in order to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."</span>

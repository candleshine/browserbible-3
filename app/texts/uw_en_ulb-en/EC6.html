<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_1" data-id="EC6_1">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it is severe for men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_2" data-id="EC6_2">God might give riches, wealth, and honor to a man so that he lacks nothing that he desires for himself, but then God gives him no ability to enjoy it. Instead, someone else uses his things. This is vapor, an evil affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_3" data-id="EC6_3">If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_4" data-id="EC6_4">Even such a baby is born in futility and passes away in darkness, and its name remains hidden.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_5" data-id="EC6_5">Although this child does not see the sun or know anything, it has rest even though that man did not.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_6" data-id="EC6_6">Even if a man should live for two thousand years but does not learn to enjoy good things, he goes to the same place as everyone else.</span>

<span class="v EC6_8" data-id="EC6_8">What advantage does the poor man have </span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">It is better to be satisfied with what the eyes see </span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC6_9" data-id="EC6_9">than to desire what a wandering appetite craves,</span>

<span class="v EC6_11" data-id="EC6_11">so what advantage is that to a man?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC6_12" data-id="EC6_12">For who knows what is good for man in his life during his futile, numbered days through which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come under the sun after he passes?</span>

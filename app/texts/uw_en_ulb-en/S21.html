<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_2" data-id="S21_2">On the third day, a man came from Saul's camp with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. When he came to David he lay facedown on the ground and prostrated himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_3" data-id="S21_3">David said to him, "Where did you come from?" He answered, "I escaped from the camp of Israel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_4" data-id="S21_4">David said to him, "Please tell me how things went." He answered, "The people fled from the battle. Many have fallen and many are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_5" data-id="S21_5">David said to the young man,  "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_6" data-id="S21_6">The young man replied, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there Saul was leaning on his spear, and chariots and riders were about to catch up with him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_7" data-id="S21_7">Saul turned around and saw me and called out to me. I answered, 'Here I am.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_8" data-id="S21_8">He said to me, 'Who are you?' I answered him, 'I am an Amalekite.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_9" data-id="S21_9">He said to me, 'Please stand over me and kill me, for great suffering has taken hold of me, but life is still in me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_10" data-id="S21_10">So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that he would not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm, and brought them here to you, my master."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_11" data-id="S21_11">Then David tore his clothes, and all the men with him did the same.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_12" data-id="S21_12">They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul, for Jonathan his son, for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel because they had fallen by the sword.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_14" data-id="S21_14">David said to him, "Why were  you not afraid to kill Yahweh's anointed king with your own hand?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_15" data-id="S21_15">David called one of the young men and said, "Go and kill him." So that man went and struck him down, and the Amalekite died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S21_16" data-id="S21_16">Then David said to the dead Amalekite, "Your blood is on your head because your own mouth has testified against you and said, 'I have killed Yahweh's anointed king.' "</span>

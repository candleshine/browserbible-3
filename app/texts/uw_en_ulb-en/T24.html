<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_1" data-id="T24_1">In the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead, and because of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly command you:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_2" data-id="T24_2">Preach the Word. Be ready when it is convenient and when it is not. Reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all patience and teaching.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_3" data-id="T24_3">For the time will come when people will not endure sound teaching. Instead, they will surround themselves with teachers who teach what agrees with their own lusts. In this way they will have their ears tickled.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_4" data-id="T24_4">They will turn their ears away from the truth and they will turn aside to myths.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_5" data-id="T24_5">But you, be sober-minded in all things; suffer hardship; do the work of an evangelist; fulfill your ministry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_6" data-id="T24_6">For I am already being poured out as an offering. The time of my departure has come.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_7" data-id="T24_7">I have competed in the good contest; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_8" data-id="T24_8">The crown of righteousness has been reserved for me—the crown that the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day—and not to me only, but also for all those who have come to love his appearing.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_9" data-id="T24_9">Do your best to come to me quickly,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_10" data-id="T24_10">for Demas has left me. He loves this present world and so has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus went to Dalmatia.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_11" data-id="T24_11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you because he is useful to me in the work.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_12" data-id="T24_12">Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_13" data-id="T24_13">The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring it when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_14" data-id="T24_14">Alexander the coppersmith displayed much ill will toward me. The Lord will repay to him according to his works.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_15" data-id="T24_15">You also should watch him, because he greatly stood against our words.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_16" data-id="T24_16">At my first defense, no one stood with me, but everyone left me. May it not be counted against them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_17" data-id="T24_17">But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me so that, through me, the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was rescued out of the lion's mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v T24_18" data-id="T24_18">The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</span>

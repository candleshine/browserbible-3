<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_1" data-id="MK5_1">They came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_2" data-id="MK5_2">Just as Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit met him. He came out of the tombs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_3" data-id="MK5_3">The man lived in the tombs. No one could restrain him any more, not even with a chain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_4" data-id="MK5_4">He had been bound many times with chains and shackles on his feet. He tore the chains apart, and his shackles were shattered. No one had the strength to subdue him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_5" data-id="MK5_5">Every night and day in the tombs and in the mountains, he cried out and cut himself with sharp stones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_6" data-id="MK5_6">When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran to him and bowed down before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_7" data-id="MK5_7">He cried out with a loud voice, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you by God himself, do not torment me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_8" data-id="MK5_8">For Jesus was saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_9" data-id="MK5_9">He asked him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "My name is Army, for we are many."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_10" data-id="MK5_10">He implored him over and over not to send them out of the region.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_11" data-id="MK5_11">Now a great herd of pigs was there feeding on the hill.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_12" data-id="MK5_12">They implored him, saying, "Send us into the pigs; let us enter into them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_13" data-id="MK5_13">He permitted them to do that. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and they rushed down the steep hill into the lake. There were about two thousand pigs that drowned in the lake. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_14" data-id="MK5_14">The men who had been tending the pigs fled and reported in the city and the countryside what had happened, and many people went out to see what had happened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_15" data-id="MK5_15">They came to Jesus, and when they saw the man who was controlled by demons sitting there, clothed and in his right mind—the man who had the Army of demons—the people were afraid.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_16" data-id="MK5_16">Those who saw what happened to the man who was controlled by demons  told those who came what they saw, and they also told them about the pigs.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_17" data-id="MK5_17">Those people who came there begged Jesus to leave their region.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_18" data-id="MK5_18">The man who had been controlled by demons came to Jesus when he was getting in a boat, about to leave. The man asked him if he might go with him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_19" data-id="MK5_19">Jesus did not permit him to come with them, but said, "Go to your house and to your people, and tell them what the Lord did for you, and what mercy he gave you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_20" data-id="MK5_20">So the man went away and he proclaimed in the Decapolis what Jesus did for him. And they all were amazed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_21" data-id="MK5_21">When Jesus crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him, and he was standing beside the lake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_22" data-id="MK5_22">One of the synagogue leaders, a man named Jairus, when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_23" data-id="MK5_23">He begged over and over, saying, "My little daughter is near death. I beg you, come and lay your hands on her that she may be made well and live."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_24" data-id="MK5_24">Jesus went with him and a great crowd followed him, and they pressed close around him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_25" data-id="MK5_25">Now there was a woman who had suffered with a discharge of blood for twelve years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_26" data-id="MK5_26">She suffered greatly under the care of many physicians. She spent all the money she had on cures. But she was never any better, only worse.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_27" data-id="MK5_27">She had heard reports about Jesus. So she came up behind him when he was walking in the crowd, and she touched his cloak.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_28" data-id="MK5_28">For she said, "If I touch just his clothes, I will be healed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_29" data-id="MK5_29">When she touched him, the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her affliction.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_30" data-id="MK5_30">Jesus at once knew in himself that power had gone out from him, and he turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_31" data-id="MK5_31">His disciples said to him, "You see this crowd pressed around you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_32" data-id="MK5_32">But Jesus looked around to see who had done it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_33" data-id="MK5_33">The woman knew what had happened to her, and so she came in fear and trembling and fell down before Jesus and told him all the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_34" data-id="MK5_34">He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healthy, free from your disease."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_35" data-id="MK5_35">While he spoke to her, people came from the synagogue leader's house, saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any more?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_36" data-id="MK5_36">But when he overheard what they said, Jesus said to the synagogue leader, "Do not be afraid. Just believe."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_37" data-id="MK5_37">He did not permit any others to be with him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_38" data-id="MK5_38">They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue. Jesus saw many upset people, people who wept and who wailed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_39" data-id="MK5_39">When he entered the house, he said to them, "Why are you upset and why do you weep? The child is not dead but sleeps."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_40" data-id="MK5_40">They laughed at him. But he put them all outside. Then he took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and he went into the room where the child was.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_41" data-id="MK5_41">He took the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha koum," which is to say, "Little girl, I say to you, get up."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_42" data-id="MK5_42">Immediately the child got up and walked (for she was twelve years of age). The people were greatly overcome and astonished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK5_43" data-id="MK5_43">He strictly ordered them that no one should know about this. And he told them to give her something to eat.</span>

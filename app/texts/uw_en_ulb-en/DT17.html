<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_1" data-id="DT17_1">You must not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox or a sheep in which is any blemish or anything bad, for that would be disgusting to Yahweh your God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_2" data-id="DT17_2">If there is found among you, within any of your city gates that Yahweh your God is giving you, any man or woman  who does what is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God and transgresses his covenant—</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_3" data-id="DT17_3">anyone who has gone and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, either the sun, the moon, or any of the host of heaven—nothing that I have commanded,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_4" data-id="DT17_4">and if you are told about this, or if you have heard of it—then you must make a careful investigation. If it is true and certain that such a detestable thing has been done in Israel— </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_5" data-id="DT17_5">—then you must bring that man or woman, who has done this evil thing, to your city gates, that very man or woman, and you must stone that person to death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_6" data-id="DT17_6">At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, will he who must die be put to death; but at the mouth of only one witness he must not be put to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_7" data-id="DT17_7">The hand of the witnesses must be the first to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people; and you will remove the evil from among you. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_8" data-id="DT17_8">If a matter arises that is too hard for you to judge—perhaps a question of murder or accidental death, of one person's right and another person's right, or a question of one kind of harm done, or another kind of matter—matters of controversy within your city gates, then you must go up to the place that Yahweh your God will choose as his sanctuary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_9" data-id="DT17_9">You must go to the priests, the descendants of Levi, and to the judge who will be serving at that time; you will seek their advice, and they will give you the verdict.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_10" data-id="DT17_10">You must follow the law given to you, at the place Yahweh will choose as his sanctuary. You will be careful to do everything that they direct you to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_11" data-id="DT17_11">Follow the law they teach you, and do according to the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right hand or to the left.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_12" data-id="DT17_12">Anyone who acts arrogantly, in not listening to the priest who is standing to serve before Yahweh your God, or in not listening to the judge—that man will die; you will put away the evil from Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_13" data-id="DT17_13">All the people must hear and fear, and act arrogantly no more. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_14" data-id="DT17_14">When you have come to the land that Yahweh your God gives you, and when you take possession of it and begin to live in it, and then you say, 'I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,'</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_15" data-id="DT17_15">then you must surely set as king over yourself someone whom Yahweh your God will choose. You must set as king over yourself someone from among your brothers. You may not put a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_16" data-id="DT17_16">But he must not multiply horses for himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt so that he may multiply horses, for Yahweh had said to you, 'You must from now on never return that way again.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_17" data-id="DT17_17">And he must not multiply wives for himself, so that his heart does not turn away from Yahweh; neither must he greatly multiply for himself silver or gold.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_18" data-id="DT17_18">When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he must write for himself in a scroll a copy of this law, from the law that is before the priests, who are Levites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_19" data-id="DT17_19">The scroll must be with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to honor Yahweh his God, so as to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to observe them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT17_20" data-id="DT17_20">He must do this so that his heart is not lifted up above his brothers, and so that he does not turn away from the commandments, to the right hand or to the left; for the purpose that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his children, among Israel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_1" data-id="JM3_1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive greater judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_2" data-id="JM3_2">For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in his words, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body also.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_3" data-id="JM3_3">Now if we put the horses' bits into their mouths they obey us, and we can turn their whole bodies.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_4" data-id="JM3_4">Notice also that ships, although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires to turn.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_5" data-id="JM3_5">Likewise the tongue is a small body part, yet boasts great things. Notice how great a forest is kindled by a spark!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_6" data-id="JM3_6">The tongue is also a fire, a world of sinfulness set among our body parts, which defiles the whole body and sets on fire the road of life, and itself is set on fire by hell.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_7" data-id="JM3_7">Every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is being tamed and has been tamed by mankind,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_8" data-id="JM3_8">but no one among man is able to tame the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_9" data-id="JM3_9">By the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and by it we curse men, who have been made in God's image.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_10" data-id="JM3_10">Out of the same mouth is spoken blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things should not be.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_11" data-id="JM3_11">Does a spring pour out both fresh and bitter water?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_12" data-id="JM3_12">My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine grow figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_13" data-id="JM3_13">Who among you is wise and understanding? Let that person demonstrate a good life by his works in the humility that comes from wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_14" data-id="JM3_14">But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_15" data-id="JM3_15">This is not a wisdom that comes down from above, but instead is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_16" data-id="JM3_16">For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is confusion and every vile practice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_17" data-id="JM3_17">But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, warm-hearted, full of mercy and good fruit, without favoring certain people, and sincere.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM3_18" data-id="JM3_18">And the fruit of righteousness is planted in peace for those who make peace.</span>

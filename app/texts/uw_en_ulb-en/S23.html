<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_1" data-id="S23_1">Now there was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David. David grew stronger and stronger, but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_2" data-id="S23_2">Sons were born to David in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam from Jezreel. </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_3" data-id="S23_3">His second son, Chileab, was born to Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. The third, Absalom, was son of Maacah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_4" data-id="S23_4">David's fourth son, Adonijah, was the son of Haggith. His fifth son was Shephatiah son of Abital, </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_5" data-id="S23_5">and the sixth, Ithream, was the son of David's wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_6" data-id="S23_6">It came about during the war between the house of Saul and the house of David that Abner made himself strong in the house of Saul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_7" data-id="S23_7">Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. Ishbosheth said to Abner, "Why have you had slept with my father's concubine?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_8" data-id="S23_8">Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ishbosheth and said, "Am I a dog's head that belongs to Judah? Today I am showing faithfulness to the house of Saul, your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, by not handing you over into the hand of David. And yet you accuse me about this woman today?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_9" data-id="S23_9">May God do so to me, Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David as Yahweh has sworn to him, </span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_10" data-id="S23_10">to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_11" data-id="S23_11">Ishbosheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_12" data-id="S23_12">Then Abner sent messengers to David to speak for him saying, "Whose land is this? Make a covenant with me, and you will see that my hand is with you, to bring all Israel to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_13" data-id="S23_13">David answered, "Good, I will make a covenant with you. But one thing I require from you is that you cannot see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_14" data-id="S23_14">Then David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid a price of one hundred Philistine foreskins."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_15" data-id="S23_15">So Ishbosheth sent for Michal  and took her from her husband,  Paltiel the son of Laish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_16" data-id="S23_16">Her husband went with her, weeping as he went, and followed her to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Return home now." So he returned.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_17" data-id="S23_17">Abner spoke with the elders of Israel saying, "In the past you were trying to have David be king over you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_18" data-id="S23_18">Now do it. For Yahweh has spoken of David saying, 'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the power of the Philistines and all their enemies.' " </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_19" data-id="S23_19">Abner also spoke personally to the people of Benjamin. Then Abner went also to speak with  David in Hebron to explain everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin desired to accomplish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_20" data-id="S23_20">When Abner and twenty of his men arrived in Hebron to see David, David had a feast prepared for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_21" data-id="S23_21">Abner explained to David, "I will arise and gather all Israel to you, my master the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, so that you may reign over all that you desire." So David sent Abner away,  and Abner left in peace.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_22" data-id="S23_22">Then the soldiers of David and Joab came from a raid and brought much plunder with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron. David had sent him away, and Abner had left in peace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_23" data-id="S23_23">When Joab and all the army with him arrived, they told Joab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and the king has sent him away, and Abner left in peace."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_24" data-id="S23_24">Then Joab came to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you! Why have you  sent him away, and he is gone?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_25" data-id="S23_25">Do you not know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you and to discover your plans and learn everything you are doing?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_26" data-id="S23_26">When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah, but David did not know this. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_27" data-id="S23_27">When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate to speak with him quietly, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach and killed him. In this way, Joab avenged the blood of Asahel his brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_28" data-id="S23_28">When David heard about this he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before Yahweh forever regarding the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_29" data-id="S23_29">Let the guilt of Abner's death fall on the head of Joab and on all his father's house. May there never  fail to be in the family of Joab someone who has a flowing sore or skin disease or who is lame and must walk with a staff or who is killed by the sword or who goes without food." </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_30" data-id="S23_30">So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel at Gibeon in battle.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_31" data-id="S23_31">David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner's body." And King David walked behind the body in the funeral procession. </span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_32" data-id="S23_32">They buried Abner in Hebron. The king wept and cried loudly at the tomb of Abner, and all the people also wept.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_33" data-id="S23_33">The king lamented for Abner and sang,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v S23_33" data-id="S23_33">"Should Abner die as a fool dies?</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_34" data-id="S23_34">Your hands were not bound.  </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v S23_34" data-id="S23_34">Your feet were not shackled.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v S23_34" data-id="S23_34">As a man falls before the sons of injustice, so you have fallen."</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v S23_34" data-id="S23_34">Once more all the people wept over him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_35" data-id="S23_35">All the people came to make David eat while it was still day, but David swore, "May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down."</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_36" data-id="S23_36">All the people took notice of David's grief, and it pleased them, as whatever the king did pleased them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_37" data-id="S23_37">So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not the king's desire to kill Abner the son of Ner.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_38" data-id="S23_38">The king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v S23_39" data-id="S23_39">And I am weak today, though I am an anointed king. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too brutal for me. May Yahweh repay the evildoer, by punishing him for his wickedness, as he deserves."</span>

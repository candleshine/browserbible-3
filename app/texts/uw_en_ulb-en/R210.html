<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_2" data-id="R210_2">It happened that Jeroboam, the son of Nebat heard of this (for he was in Egypt, to where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon; but Jeroboam returned from Egypt).</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_3" data-id="R210_3">So they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all Israel came; they spoke to Rehoboam and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_4" data-id="R210_4">"Your father made our yoke difficult. Now therefore, make your father's hard work easier, and lighten the heavy yoke that he put on us, and we will serve you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_5" data-id="R210_5">Rehoboam said to them, "Come again to me after three days." So the people left.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_6" data-id="R210_6">King Rehoboam consulted with the old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he was alive; he said, "How would you advise me to bring an answer to these people?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_7" data-id="R210_7">They spoke to him and said, "If you are good to this people and please them, and say good words to them, then they will always be your servants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_8" data-id="R210_8">But Rehoboam ignored the advice of the old men that they had given him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_9" data-id="R210_9">He said to them, "What advice do you give me, so that we may answer the people who spoke to me and said, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_10" data-id="R210_10">The young men who had grown up with Rehoboam spoke with him, saying, "Speak to the people who told you that your father Solomon made their yoke heavy but that you must make it lighter. You should say to them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_11" data-id="R210_11">So now, although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father punished you with whips, but I will punish you with scorpions.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_13" data-id="R210_13">The king answered them roughly; King Rehoboam ignored the advice of the old men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v R210_14" data-id="R210_14">He spoke to them following the advice of the young men; he said, </span>

<div class="c">1</div>
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_1" data-id="JM1_1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes of the Dispersion, greetings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_2" data-id="JM1_2">Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you experience various troubles,</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_3" data-id="JM1_3">knowing that the testing of your faith works endurance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_4" data-id="JM1_4">Let endurance complete its work, that you may be completely mature, lacking in nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_5" data-id="JM1_5">But if any of you need wisdom, ask for it from God, the one who gives it generously and without rebuke to all who ask, and he will grant it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_6" data-id="JM1_6">But ask in faith, without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave in the sea, driven by the wind and tossed around.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_7" data-id="JM1_7">For that person must not think that he will receive his request of the Lord;</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_8" data-id="JM1_8">such a person is a double-minded person, unstable in all his ways.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_9" data-id="JM1_9">The poor brother should glory in his high standing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_10" data-id="JM1_10">while the rich brother in his humility, because he will pass away like a wild flower in the field passes.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_11" data-id="JM1_11">The sun rises with scorching heat and dries up the plant, and the flower falls off and its beauty dies. In the same way the rich people will fade away in the middle of their activities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_12" data-id="JM1_12">Blessed is the man who endures testing, for after he has passed the test, he will receive the crown of life, which has been promised to those who love God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_13" data-id="JM1_13">No one should say when he is tempted, "This temptation is from God," because God is not tempted by evil, and God himself does not tempt anyone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_14" data-id="JM1_14">Each person is tempted by his own evil desires which entice and drag him away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_15" data-id="JM1_15">Then after sinful desires conceive, sin is born, and after sin is full grown it results in death. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_16" data-id="JM1_16">Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_17" data-id="JM1_17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. He does not change like shifting shadows. </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_18" data-id="JM1_18">God chose to give us life by the word of truth, so that we would be like firstfruits among his creatures.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_19" data-id="JM1_19">You know this, my beloved brothers. Every man must be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_20" data-id="JM1_20">for the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_21" data-id="JM1_21">Therefore put away all sinful filth and the evil that is everywhere, and in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_22" data-id="JM1_22">Obey the word, do not only hear it, deceiving your own selves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_23" data-id="JM1_23">For if anyone hears the word and does not do it, he is like a man examining his natural face in a mirror.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_24" data-id="JM1_24">He examines his face, and goes away and soon forgets what he looked like.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_25" data-id="JM1_25">But the person who looks carefully into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and continues obeying it, not just being a hearer who forgets, this man will be blessed as he does it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_26" data-id="JM1_26">If anyone thinks himself to be religious, but he does not control his tongue, he deceives his heart and his religion is vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v JM1_27" data-id="JM1_27">Pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father is this: to help the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to protect oneself from the world's corruption.</span>

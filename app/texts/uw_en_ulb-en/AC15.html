<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_1" data-id="AC15_1">Certain men came down from Judea and taught the brothers, saying, "Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_2" data-id="AC15_2">When Paul and Barnabas had a confrontation and debate with them, the brothers decided that Paul, Barnabas, and certain others should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_3" data-id="AC15_3">They therefore, being sent by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria and announced the conversion of the Gentiles. They brought great joy to all the brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_4" data-id="AC15_4">When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all the things that God had done with them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_5" data-id="AC15_5">But certain men who believed, who belonged to the group of Pharisees, stood up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_6" data-id="AC15_6">So the apostles and the elders gathered together to consider this matter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_7" data-id="AC15_7">After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them,</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v AC15_7" data-id="AC15_7">"Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_8" data-id="AC15_8">God, who knows the heart, witnesses to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us;</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_9" data-id="AC15_9">and he made no distinction between us and them, making their hearts clean by faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_10" data-id="AC15_10">Now therefore why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_11" data-id="AC15_11">But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were."</span>

<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_27" data-id="AC15_27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_28" data-id="AC15_28">For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC15_29" data-id="AC15_29">that you turn away from things sacrificed to idols, blood, things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, it shall be well with you. Farewell."</span>

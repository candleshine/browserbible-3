<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_1" data-id="H23_1">And now, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glorified, even as it also is with you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_2" data-id="H23_2">and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people, for not all have faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_3" data-id="H23_3">But the Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_4" data-id="H23_4">We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you both do and will continue to do the things that we command.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_5" data-id="H23_5">May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of Christ.</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_6" data-id="H23_6">Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you avoid every brother who lives idly and not according to the traditions that you received from us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_7" data-id="H23_7">For you know yourselves how you ought to imitate us. We did not live before you in a lazy manner. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_8" data-id="H23_8">And we did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, we worked night and day in difficult labor and hardship, so we might not be a burden to any of you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_9" data-id="H23_9">It is not that we do not have authority, but that we should be an example to you, so that you may imitate us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_10" data-id="H23_10">When we were with you we commanded you, "If any one does not want to work, he should not eat."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_11" data-id="H23_11">For we hear that some walk idly among you; they do not work but are instead meddlers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_12" data-id="H23_12">Now such ones we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they should work and eat their own food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_13" data-id="H23_13">But you, brothers, do not lose heart in doing what is right.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_14" data-id="H23_14">If anyone does not obey our word in this letter, take note of him and have no association with him, so that he may be ashamed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v H23_15" data-id="H23_15">Do not consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_1" data-id="K119_1">Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_2" data-id="K119_2">Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, "So may the gods do to me, and more also, if I do not make your life like the life of one of those dead prophets by tomorrow about this time."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_3" data-id="K119_3">When Elijah heard that, he arose and fled for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_4" data-id="K119_4">But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a broom tree. He requested for himself that he might die, and said, "It is enough, now, Yahweh; take away my life, for I am no better than my dead  ancestors."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_5" data-id="K119_5">So he lay down and slept under a broom tree; unexpectedly an angel touched him and said to him, "Get up and eat."</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_6" data-id="K119_6">Elijah looked, and near his head was bread that had been baked on coals and a jug of water. So he ate and drank and then lay down again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_7" data-id="K119_7">The angel of Yahweh came again a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, because the journey will be too much for you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_8" data-id="K119_8">So he arose and ate and drank, and he traveled in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_9" data-id="K119_9">He went to a cave there and stayed in it. Then the word of Yahweh came to him and said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_10" data-id="K119_10">Elijah replied, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of hosts, for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I, only I, am left and they are also trying to take my life."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_11" data-id="K119_11">Yahweh replied, "Go out and stand on the mountain before me." Then Yahweh passed by, and a very strong wind struck the mountains and broke rocks into pieces before Yahweh,  but Yahweh was not in the wind. Then after the wind, an earthquake came, but Yahweh was not in the earthquake.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_12" data-id="K119_12">Then after the earthquake a fire came, but Yahweh was not in the fire. Then after the fire, a still small voice came.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_13" data-id="K119_13">When Elijah heard the voice, he wrapped his face in his cloak, went out, and stood at the entrance of the cave. Then a voice came to him that said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_14" data-id="K119_14">Elijah replied, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of hosts, because the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I, only I, am left and they are also trying to take my life."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_15" data-id="K119_15">Then Yahweh said to him, "Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus, and when you arrive you will anoint Hazael to be king over Aram,</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_16" data-id="K119_16">and you will anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel, and you will anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_17" data-id="K119_17">It will happen that Jehu will kill whoever escapes from the sword of Hazael, and that Elisha will kill whoever escapes from the sword of Jehu.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_18" data-id="K119_18">But I will leave for myself seven thousand people in Israel, whose knees have not bent down to Baal, and whose mouths have not kissed him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_19" data-id="K119_19">So Elijah left from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he himself was plowing with the twelfth yoke. Elijah walked over to Elisha and draped his cloak on him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_20" data-id="K119_20">Then Elisha left the oxen and ran after Elijah; he said, "Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you." Then Elijah said to him, "Go back, but think about what I have done to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K119_21" data-id="K119_21">So Elisha returned from Elijah and took the yoke of oxen, killed the animals, and cooked the meat with the wood from the ox yoke; then he gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, went after Elijah, and served him.</span>

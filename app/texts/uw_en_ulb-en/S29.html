<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_1" data-id="S29_1">David said, "Is there anyone left in Saul's family to whom I may show  kindness for Jonathan's sake?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_2" data-id="S29_2">There was in Saul's family a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David. The king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" He replied, "Yes. I am your servant." </span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_3" data-id="S29_3">So the king said, "Is there not anyone left of Saul's family to whom I may show the kindness of God?" Ziba replied to the king, "Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_4" data-id="S29_4">The king said to him, "Where is he?" Ziba replied to the king, "Look, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel in Lo Debar."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_5" data-id="S29_5">Then King David sent and had him brought out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo Debar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_6" data-id="S29_6">So Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and bowed down his face to the floor in honor of David. David said, "Mephibosheth." He answered, "See, I am your servant!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_7" data-id="S29_7">David said to him, "Do not be afraid, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and I will restore to you all the land of Saul your grandfather, and you will always eat at my table."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_8" data-id="S29_8">Mephibosheth bowed and said, "What is your servant, that you should look with favor on such a dead dog as I am?"</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_9" data-id="S29_9">Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "I have given to your master's son all the possessions of  Saul and his family.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_10" data-id="S29_10">You are to plow the land for him, you and your sons and your servants,  and you must harvest the crops so that your master's grandson may have food to eat. But Mephibosheth your master's grandson will always eat at my table." Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_11" data-id="S29_11">Then Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do all that my master the king commands his servant." The king added, "As for Mephibosheth  he will eat at my table, as one of the king's sons."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_12" data-id="S29_12">Mephibosheth had a young son  whose name was Mica. And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S29_13" data-id="S29_13">So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, and he always ate at the king's table, though he was lame in both his feet.</span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_11" data-id="EC3_11">God has made everything suitable for its own time. He has also placed eternity in their hearts. But mankind cannot understand the deeds that God has done, from their beginning all the way to their end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_12" data-id="EC3_12">I know that there is nothing better for anyone than to rejoice and to do good so long as he livesâ€”</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_16" data-id="EC3_16">And I have seen that under the sun wickedness exists where there should be justice, and in place of righteousness wickedness is often found.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_17" data-id="EC3_17">I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked at the right time for every matter and every deed."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_18" data-id="EC3_18">I said in my heart, "God tests human beings to show them that they are like animals."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_19" data-id="EC3_19">For the same fate happens to human beings that happens to animals. Like animals, people all die. They all must breathe the same air, so in that way mankind has no advantage over the animals. Is not everything just a rapid breath?</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_20" data-id="EC3_20">Everything is going to the same place. Everything comes from the dust, and everything returns to the dust.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_21" data-id="EC3_21">Who knows whether the spirit of mankind goes upward and the spirit of animals goes downward into the earth?</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC3_22" data-id="EC3_22">So again I realized that there is nothing better for anyone than to take pleasure in his work, for that is his assignment. Who can bring him back to see what happens after him? f</span>

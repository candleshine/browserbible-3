<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_3" data-id="AC22_3">"I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but educated in this city at the feet of Gamaliel. I was instructed according to the strict ways of the law of our forefathers. I am zealous for God, just as all of you are today.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_4" data-id="AC22_4">I persecuted this Way to the death; I tied up both men and women and delivered them into prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_5" data-id="AC22_5">Also the high priest and all the elders can bear witness that I received letters from them for the brothers in Damascus, for me to journey there. I was to bring back in bonds to Jerusalem those of this Way in order to be punished.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_6" data-id="AC22_6">It happened that when I was traveling and nearing Damascus, about noon suddenly a great light from heaven  began to shine around me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_7" data-id="AC22_7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_8" data-id="AC22_8">I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' He said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_9" data-id="AC22_9">Those who were with me saw the light, but they did not hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_10" data-id="AC22_10">I said, 'What should I do, Lord?' The Lord said to me, 'Arise and go into Damascus; there  you will be told everything that you must do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_11" data-id="AC22_11">I could not see because of that light's brightness, so I went into Damascus being led by the hands of those who were with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_12" data-id="AC22_12">There I met a man named Ananias, a devout man according to the law and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_13" data-id="AC22_13">He came to me, stood by me, and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.'  In that very hour I saw him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_14" data-id="AC22_14">Then he said, 'The God of our forefathers has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear the voice coming from his own mouth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_15" data-id="AC22_15">For you shall be a witness for him to all men about what you have seen and heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_16" data-id="AC22_16">And now why are you waiting? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_17" data-id="AC22_17">After I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, it happened that I was given a vision.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_18" data-id="AC22_18">I saw him say to me, 'Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_19" data-id="AC22_19">I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you in every synagogue.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_20" data-id="AC22_20">When the blood of Stephen your witness was spilled, I also was standing by and agreeing, and I was guarding the clothings of those who killed him.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_21" data-id="AC22_21">But he said to me, 'Leave, because I will send you away to the Gentiles.'"</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_22" data-id="AC22_22">The people allowed him to speak up to this point. But then they shouted and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not right that he should live."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_23" data-id="AC22_23">As they were shouting, throwing off their garments, and throwing dust into the air,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_24" data-id="AC22_24">the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought into the fortress. He ordered that he should be  questioned with scourging, so  that he himself might know why they were shouting against him like that.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_25" data-id="AC22_25">When they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_26" data-id="AC22_26">When the centurion heard this, he went to the chief captain and told him, saying, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_27" data-id="AC22_27">The chief captain came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" Paul said, "Yes."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_28" data-id="AC22_28">The chief captain answered, "It was only with a large amount of money that I acquired citizenship." But Paul said, "I was born a Roman citizen."</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_29" data-id="AC22_29">Then the men who were going to question him left him immediately. The chief captain also was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, because he had tied him up.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC22_30" data-id="AC22_30">On the next day, the chief captain wanted to know the truth about the Jews' accusations against Paul. So he untied his bonds and ordered the chief priests and all the council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and placed him in their midst.</span>

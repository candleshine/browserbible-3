<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v R110_4" data-id="R110_4">Then said Saul to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and thrust me through with it. Otherwise, these uncircumcised will come and abuse me."  But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v R110_5" data-id="R110_5">When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword and died.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v R110_13" data-id="R110_13">So Saul died because he was unfaithful to Yahweh. He did not obey Yahweh's instructions, but asked for advice from someone who talked with the dead.</span>

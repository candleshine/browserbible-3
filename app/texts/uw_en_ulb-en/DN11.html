<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_1" data-id="DN11_1">"In the first year of Darius the Mede, I myself came to support and protect Michael.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_2" data-id="DN11_2">And now I will reveal a truth to you. Three kings will arise in Persia, and a fourth will be far richer than all the others. When he has gained power through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_3" data-id="DN11_3">A mighty king will rise up who will rule a very great kingdom, and he will do everything he wants. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_4" data-id="DN11_4">When he rises up, his kingdom will be broken and divided to the four winds of heaven. However, it will not be given to his own descendants, and it will not have the power that it had when he was ruling over it. For his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others who are not his own descendants.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_5" data-id="DN11_5">The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become stronger than he and will rule an even greater kingdom. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_6" data-id="DN11_6">After a few years, when the time is right, they will make an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to confirm the agreement. But she will lose her power, and she will be abandoned—she and those who brought her, and her father, and the one who supported her in those times.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_7" data-id="DN11_7">But a branch from her roots will rise up in her place. He will attack the army and enter the fortress of the king of the North. He will fight them, and he will conquer them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_8" data-id="DN11_8">He will carry off to Egypt their gods along with their cast metal figures and their precious vessels of silver and of gold, and for some years he will refrain from attacking the king of the North.</span>

</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_10" data-id="DN11_10">His sons will wage war and assemble a great army, which will keep coming and will overflow like a flood, pass through, and repeat the assault all the way to his fortress.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_11" data-id="DN11_11">The king of the South will march out in a rage and will fight against the king of the North. The king of the North will raise up a great army, but it will be handed over to the king of the South.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_12" data-id="DN11_12">When the army is carried off, the king of the South will be filled with pride, and will have many thousands of his enemies killed. But he will not succeed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_13" data-id="DN11_13">The king of the North will raise up another army, greater than the first. After some years, the king of the North will surely come with a great army supplied with much equipment. </span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_14" data-id="DN11_14">In those times many will rise against the king of the South. The most violent among your people will raise themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will stumble and fall.</span>

<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_18" data-id="DN11_18">After this, the king of the North will give attention to the coastlands and will capture many of them. But a commander will put an end to his insolence and will cause his insolence to turn back upon him. </span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_19" data-id="DN11_19">Then he will give attention to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall; he will not be found.</span>

<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_21" data-id="DN11_21">In his place will rise up a despised person to whom the people will not have given the honor of royalty; he will come in quietly and will take over the kingdom by flattery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_22" data-id="DN11_22">A great army will be swept away like a flood before him. Both that army and the leader established by the covenant will be destroyed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_23" data-id="DN11_23">From the time an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully; with only a small number of people he will become strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_24" data-id="DN11_24">Without warning he will come into the richest part of the province, and he will do what neither his father or his father's father did—spreading among his followers the booty, the plunder, and the wealth. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses, but only for a time.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_25" data-id="DN11_25">He will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South with a great army.

<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_26" data-id="DN11_26">Even those who eat food from the king's table will try to destroy him. His army will be swept away like a flood, and many of them will be killed.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_28" data-id="DN11_28">Then the king of the North will return into his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will do what he wants, and return to his own land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_29" data-id="DN11_29">At the appointed time he will return and invade the South again. But this time it will not be as it was before. </span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_30" data-id="DN11_30">For ships of Kittim will come against him, and he will be disheartened and will turn back. He will be enraged against the holy covenant, and he will show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_31" data-id="DN11_31">His forces will rise up and profane the sanctuary and the fortress; they will take away the regular burnt offering, and they will set up the abomination that causes complete desolation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_32" data-id="DN11_32">He will flatter those who have violated the covenant and will seduce them, but the people who know their God will be strong and will take action.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_33" data-id="DN11_33">The wise among the people will give understanding to many. But for days they will fall by the sword and by flame, they will be taken as prisoners and robbed of their possessions. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_34" data-id="DN11_34">When they stumble, they will receive a little help, and many will join them who do not mean what they say. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_36" data-id="DN11_36">The king will do whatever he wants. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god, and will speak astonishing things against the God of gods. He will succeed until the wrath is completed. For what has been decreed will be done. </span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_37" data-id="DN11_37">He will show no consideration for the gods of his ancestors, for the god desired by women, or for any other god. He will act proudly and claim to be above them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_38" data-id="DN11_38">Instead of them, he will honor the god of fortresses. He will honor a god whom his ancestors did not know with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_39" data-id="DN11_39">He will attack the strongest fortresses with the help of people who belong to a foreign god.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN11_40" data-id="DN11_40">At the time of the end the king of the South will attack.

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_1" data-id="C15_1">We heard a report that there is sexual immorality among you, a kind of immorality that is not even permitted among the Gentiles. The report is that one of you is sleeping with his father's wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_2" data-id="C15_2">And you are so arrogant! Should you not mourn instead? The one who did this must be removed from among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_3" data-id="C15_3">For, although I am absent in body but still present in spirit, I have already judged the one who did this, just as though I were there. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_4" data-id="C15_4">When you gather together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and my spirit is there as well in the power of our Lord Jesus, I have already judged this person.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_5" data-id="C15_5">I have done this to hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_6" data-id="C15_6">Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little yeast leavens the whole loaf?</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_7" data-id="C15_7">Cleanse yourselves of the old yeast so that you may be new dough, so that you may be unleavened bread. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_8" data-id="C15_8">So let us then celebrate the festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of bad behavior and wickedness. Instead, let us celebrate with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_9" data-id="C15_9">I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_10" data-id="C15_10">In no way did I mean the immoral people of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters, since to stay away from them you would need to go out of the world.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_11" data-id="C15_11">But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother or sister in Christ but who is living in sexually immorality, or who is greedy, or is an idolater, or is verbally abusive, or is a drunkard, or a swindler. Do not even eat a meal with such a person.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_12" data-id="C15_12">For how am I involved with judging those who are outside the church? Instead, are you not to judge those who are inside the church?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C15_13" data-id="C15_13">But God judges those who are on the outside: </span>

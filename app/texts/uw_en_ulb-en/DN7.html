<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_1" data-id="DN7_1">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylonia, Daniel had a dream and visions in his mind while lying on his bed. Then he wrote down what he had seen in the dream. He wrote down the most important events:</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_2" data-id="DN7_2">Daniel explained, "In my vision at night I saw that the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_3" data-id="DN7_3">Four large animals, each one different from the other, came up out of the sea. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_4" data-id="DN7_4">The first was like a lion but had eagle's wings. As I was looking, its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground and made to stand on two feet, like a man. The mind of a man was given to it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_5" data-id="DN7_5">Then there was a second animal, like a bear, and it was bending over; it had three ribs between its teeth in its mouth. It was told, 'Get up and devour many people.' </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_6" data-id="DN7_6">After this I looked again. There was another animal, one that looked like a leopard. On its back it had four wings like bird wings, and it had four heads. It was given authority to rule.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_7" data-id="DN7_7">After this I saw in my dream at night a fourth animal, terrifying, frightening, and very strong. It had large iron teeth; it devoured,  broke in pieces, and trampled underfoot what was left. It was different from the other animals, and it had ten horns.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_8" data-id="DN7_8">While I was considering the horns, I looked and saw another horn grow up among them, a little horn. Three of the first horns were wrenched out by the roots. I saw in this horn eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that was boasting about great things.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">As I looked, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">thrones were set in place, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and the Ancient of Days took his seat. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">His clothing was as white as snow, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and the hair of his head was like pure wool. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">His throne was flames of fire,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_9" data-id="DN7_9">and its wheels were burning fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">A river of fire flowed out from before him; </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">millions served him, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">and one hundred million were standing before him.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">The court was in session, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_10" data-id="DN7_10">and the books were opened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_11" data-id="DN7_11">I continued to look because of the boastful words spoken by the horn. I watched while the animal was killed, and its body was destroyed, and it was handed over to be burned up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_12" data-id="DN7_12">As for the rest of the four animals, their authority to rule was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a period of time.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">In my visions that night,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">I saw one coming with the clouds of heaven like a son of man; </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">he came to the Ancient of Days </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_13" data-id="DN7_13">and was presented before him.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">Authority to rule and glory and royal power were given to him </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">so that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">His authority to rule is an everlasting authority that will not pass away, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_14" data-id="DN7_14">and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_15" data-id="DN7_15">As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved inside of me, and the visions I saw in my mind troubled me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_16" data-id="DN7_16">I approached one of them standing there and asked him to show me the meaning of these things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_17" data-id="DN7_17">'These large animals, four in number, are four kings that will arise from the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_18" data-id="DN7_18">But the holy people of the Most High will receive the kingdom, and they will possess it forever and ever.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_19" data-id="DN7_19">Then I wanted to know more about the fourth animalâ€”it was so different from the others and very horrific with its iron teeth and bronze claws; it devoured, broke into pieces, and trampled on what was left with its feet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_20" data-id="DN7_20">I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head, and about the other horn that grew up before which the three horns fell down. I wanted to know about the horn that had eyes and about the mouth that boasted about great things and that seemed greater than its companions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_21" data-id="DN7_21">As I looked, this horn waged war against the holy people and was defeating them </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_22" data-id="DN7_22">until the Ancient of Days came, and justice was given to the holy people of the Most High. Then the time came when the holy people received the kingdom. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v DN7_23" data-id="DN7_23">This is what that person said, 'As for the fourth animal, </span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v DN7_23" data-id="DN7_23">it will be a fourth kingdom on earth </span>

</div>
<div class="q">

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_1" data-id="AC6_1">Now in these days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint by the Grecian Jews began against the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_2" data-id="AC6_2">The twelve apostles called the multitude of the disciples to them and said, "It is not right for us to give up the word of God in order to serve tables.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_3" data-id="AC6_3">You should therefore choose, brothers, seven men from among yourselves, men of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_5" data-id="AC6_5">Their speech pleased the whole multitude. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte from Antioch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC6_6" data-id="AC6_6">The believers brought these men before the apostles, who prayed and then placed their hands upon them.</span>

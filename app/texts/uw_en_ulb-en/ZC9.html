<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_1" data-id="ZC9_1">This is a declaration of  Yahweh's word concerning the land of Hadrach and Damascus. For Yahweh's eye is on all mankind, and also on all the tribes of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_2" data-id="ZC9_2">This declaration also concerns Hamath, which borders on Damascus, and it concerns Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_3" data-id="ZC9_3">Tyre has built herself a stronghold and heaped up silver like dust and refined gold like mud in the streets.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_4" data-id="ZC9_4">Look! The Lord will dispossess her and destroy her strength on the sea, so she will be devoured by fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_5" data-id="ZC9_5">Ashkelon will see and be afraid! Gaza also will tremble greatly! Ekron, her hopes will be disappointed! The king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall no longer be inhabited!</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_6" data-id="ZC9_6">Yahweh says, "Strangers will make their homes in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_7" data-id="ZC9_7">For I will remove their blood from their mouths and their abominations from between their teeth." Then they will become a remnant for our God like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will become like the Jebusites.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_8" data-id="ZC9_8">Yahweh says, "I will camp around my land against enemy armies so no one can pass through or return, for no oppressor will pass any more through it. For now I will watch over my land with my own eyes!</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem! </span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v ZC9_9" data-id="ZC9_9">and is rescuing you. He is humble and is riding on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_10" data-id="ZC9_10">Then I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow will be cut off from battle; for he will speak peace to the nations, and his dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth!</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_11" data-id="ZC9_11">And you—because of the blood of my covenant with you—I have set free your prisoners from the pit where there is no water.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_12" data-id="ZC9_12">Return to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! Even today I am declaring that I will return double to you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_13" data-id="ZC9_13">for I have bent Judah as my bow. I have filled my quiver with Ephraim. I have roused your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, and have made you, Zion, like a warrior's sword!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_14" data-id="ZC9_14">Yahweh will appear to them, and his arrows will shoot out like lightning! For my Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet and will advance with the storms from Teman.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_15" data-id="ZC9_15">Yahweh of hosts will defend them, and they will devour them and defeat the stones of the slings. Then they will drink  and shout like men drunk on wine, and they will be filled with wine like bowls at the altar, like the corners of the altar.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_16" data-id="ZC9_16">So Yahweh their God will rescue them on that day; they will be like a flock containing his people, for they will be the jewels of a crown, raised up over his land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v ZC9_17" data-id="ZC9_17">How good and how beautiful they will be! The young men will flourish on grain and the virgins on sweet wine!</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_1" data-id="HB3_1">Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_2" data-id="HB3_2">He was faithful to God, who appointed him, as Moses was also faithful in all God's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_3" data-id="HB3_3">For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, because the one who builds a house has more honor than the house itself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_4" data-id="HB3_4">For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_5" data-id="HB3_5">Moses was indeed faithful as a servant in all God's house, giving a testimony about the things that were to be spoken of in the future.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_6" data-id="HB3_6">But Christ is the Son in charge of God's house. We are his house if we hold fast to our confidence and pride of confidence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_7" data-id="HB3_7">Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says:</span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">Do not harden your hearts</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">as the Israelites did in the rebellion,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_8" data-id="HB3_8">in the time of testing in the wilderness.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_9" data-id="HB3_9">This was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_9" data-id="HB3_9">and when, during forty years, they saw my deeds.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">Therefore I was displeased with that generation.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">I said, 'They are always going astray in their hearts,</span>

<span class="v HB3_10" data-id="HB3_10">and they do not know my ways.</span>
</div>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_11" data-id="HB3_11">It is as I swore in my anger:</span>
</div>

<span class="v HB3_11" data-id="HB3_11">they will not enter my rest.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_12" data-id="HB3_12">Be careful, brothers, so that there may not be an evil heart of unbelief in any of you, a heart that will turn away from the living God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_13" data-id="HB3_13">Instead, encourage one another daily, so long as it is called today, so that no one among you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_14" data-id="HB3_14">For we have become partners of Christ if we firmly hold to our confidence in him from the beginning to the end.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_15" data-id="HB3_15">About this it has been said,</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_17" data-id="HB3_17">And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies lay in the wilderness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_18" data-id="HB3_18">To whom did God swear that they would not enter his rest, if it was not to those who were disobeying him?</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB3_19" data-id="HB3_19">We see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief.</span>

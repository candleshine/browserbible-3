<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_1" data-id="AC4_1">As Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_2" data-id="AC4_2">They were deeply troubled because Peter and John were teaching the people about Jesus and proclaiming his resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_3" data-id="AC4_3">They arrested them and put them in jail until the next morning, since  it was now evening.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_4" data-id="AC4_4">But many of the people who had heard the message believed; and the number of the men who believed was about five thousand.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_5" data-id="AC4_5">It came about on the next day, that their rulers, elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_6" data-id="AC4_6">Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and all who were relatives of the high priest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_7" data-id="AC4_7">When they had set Peter and John in their midst, they asked them, "By what power, or in what name, have you done this?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_8" data-id="AC4_8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "You rulers of the people, and elders,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_9" data-id="AC4_9">if we this day are being questioned concerning a good deed done to a sick man— by what means was this man made well?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_10" data-id="AC4_10">May this be known to you all and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead— it is by him that  this man stands here healthy before you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_11" data-id="AC4_11">Jesus Christ is the stone which you as builders despised but which has been made the head cornerstone.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_12" data-id="AC4_12">There is no salvation in any other person: for there is no other name under heaven, that is given among men, by which we must be saved."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_13" data-id="AC4_13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and realized that they were ordinary, uneducated men, they were surprised, becoming aware that Peter and John had been with Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_14" data-id="AC4_14">Because they saw the man who was healed standing with them, the Jewish leaders could say nothing against  them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_15" data-id="AC4_15">But after they had commanded the apostles to leave the council meeting, they talked among themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_16" data-id="AC4_16">They said, "What shall we do to these men? For the fact that a remarkable miracle has been done through them is known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem; we cannot deny it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_17" data-id="AC4_17">But in order that it spreads no further among the people, let us warn them not to speak anymore to anyone in this name."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_18" data-id="AC4_18">They called Peter and John in and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_19" data-id="AC4_19">But Peter and John answered and said to them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to obey you rather than him,  you judge. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_20" data-id="AC4_20">For we cannot help speaking about the things that we have seen and heard."</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_21" data-id="AC4_21">After further warning Peter and John, they let them go. They were unable to find any excuse to punish them, because all of the people were praising God for what had been done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_22" data-id="AC4_22">The man who had experienced this miracle of healing was more than forty years old.</span>

<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_23" data-id="AC4_23">After they were set free, Peter and John came to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_24" data-id="AC4_24">When they heard it, they raised their voices together  to God and said, "Lord, you who made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">you who by the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David your servant, said, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">'Why did the Gentile nations rage,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_25" data-id="AC4_25">and the peoples imagine useless things?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">The kings of the earth set themselves together,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">and the rulers gathered together</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC4_26" data-id="AC4_26">against the Lord, and against his Christ.' </span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_27" data-id="AC4_27">Indeed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered together in this city against your holy Servant Jesus, whom you anointed.   </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_28" data-id="AC4_28">They gathered together to do all that your hand and your desire decided in advance would happen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_29" data-id="AC4_29">Now, Lord, look upon their warnings and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_30" data-id="AC4_30">So that while you stretch out your hand to heal, signs and wonders may happen through the name of your holy servant Jesus."</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_31" data-id="AC4_31">When they finished praying, the place where they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_32" data-id="AC4_32">The great number of those who believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that anything he possessed was really his own; instead, they had all things in common.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_33" data-id="AC4_33">With great power the apostles were proclaiming their testimony about the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_34" data-id="AC4_34">There was no person among them who lacked anything,  for all who owned title to lands or houses sold them and brought the money of the things that were sold</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC4_35" data-id="AC4_35">and laid it at the apostles' feet. And distribution was made to each believer, according as any one had need.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_1" data-id="RV11_1">A reed was given to me to use like a measuring rod. I was told, "Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and those who worship in it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_2" data-id="RV11_2">But do not measure the courtyard outside the temple, for it has been given over to the Gentiles. They will trample the holy city for  forty-two months.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_3" data-id="RV11_3">I will give my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_4" data-id="RV11_4">These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_5" data-id="RV11_5">If anyone chooses to harm them, fire comes out of their mouth and devours their enemies. Anyone who wishes to harm must be killed in this way.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_6" data-id="RV11_6">These witnesses have authority to close up the sky so no rain will fall during the time when they prophesy. They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they wish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_7" data-id="RV11_7">When they will have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the deep and endless pit will make war against them. He will conquer them and kill them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_8" data-id="RV11_8">Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city (which is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt) where their Lord was crucified.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_9" data-id="RV11_9">For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language, and nation will look at their bodies and they will not permit them to be placed in a tomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_10" data-id="RV11_10">Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate, even sending gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_11" data-id="RV11_11">But after three and a half days a breath of life from God will enter them and they will stand on their feet. Great fear will fall on those who see them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_12" data-id="RV11_12">Then they will hear a loud voice from heaven say to them, "Come up here!" And they will go up into heaven in a cloud, while their enemies look on.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV11_13" data-id="RV11_13">At that hour there will be a major earthquake and a tenth part of the city will collapse. Seven thousand people will be killed in the earthquake and the survivors will be terrified and give glory to the God of heaven.</span>

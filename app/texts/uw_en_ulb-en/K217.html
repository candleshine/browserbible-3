<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_1" data-id="K217_1">In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, the reign of Hoshea the son of Elah began. He ruled in Samaria over Israel for nine years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_2" data-id="K217_2">He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, yet not as the kings of Israel who were before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_3" data-id="K217_3">Shalmaneser king of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his servant and brought him tribute.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_4" data-id="K217_4">Then the king of Assyria realized that Hoshea had been plotting against him, for Hoshea had sent messengers to So king of Egypt; also, he offered no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. So the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_5" data-id="K217_5">Then the king of Assyria attacked throughout all the land, and attacked Samaria and besieged it for three years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_6" data-id="K217_6">In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away to Assyria. He put them in Halah, at the Habor River of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_7" data-id="K217_7">This captivity happened because the people of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt, from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. The people had been worshiping other gods</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_8" data-id="K217_8">and walking in the practices of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel, and in the practices of the kings of Israel that they had done.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_9" data-id="K217_9">The people of Israel secretly did things that were not right against Yahweh their God. They built shrines in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_10" data-id="K217_10">They also set up sacred stone pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_11" data-id="K217_11">There they burned incense in all the shrines, as the nations had done, those whom Yahweh had carried away before them. The Israelites performed wicked things to provoke Yahweh to anger;</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_12" data-id="K217_12">they worshiped idols, about which Yahweh had said to them, "You will not do this thing."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_13" data-id="K217_13">Yet Yahweh had testified to Israel and to Judah by every prophet and every seer, saying, "Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes, and be careful to keep all the law I commanded your fathers, and that I sent to you by my servants the prophets."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_14" data-id="K217_14">But they would not listen; instead they were very stubborn like their fathers who did not trust in Yahweh their God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_15" data-id="K217_15">They rejected his statutes and the covenant that he had made with their ancestors, and the covenant decrees that he had given to them. They followed useless practices and they themselves became useless. They followed the pagan nations who were around them, those that Yahweh had commanded them not to imitate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_16" data-id="K217_16">They ignored all the commandments of Yahweh their God. They made cast metal figures of two calves to worship. They made an Asherah pole, and they worshiped all the stars of the heavens and Baal.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_17" data-id="K217_17">They sacrificed their sons and  daughters in the fire as burnt offerings, used divination and enchantments, sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and provoked him to anger.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_18" data-id="K217_18">Therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight. There was no one left but the tribe of Judah alone.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_19" data-id="K217_19">Even Judah did not keep the commandments of Yahweh their God, but instead followed in the same pagan practices that Israel was following.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_20" data-id="K217_20">So Yahweh rejected all the descendants of Israel;  he afflicted them and gave them into the hand of those who would take the possession as spoil, until he had cast them out of his sight.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_21" data-id="K217_21">He tore Israel from the royal line of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king. Jeroboam drove Israel away from following Yahweh and made them commit a great sin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_22" data-id="K217_22">The people of Israel followed all the sins of Jeroboam  and they did not depart from them, </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_23" data-id="K217_23">so Yahweh removed Israel from his sight, as he had said through all his servants the prophets that he would. So Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria, and it is this way to this present day.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_24" data-id="K217_24">The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria in place of the people of Israel. They took over Samaria and lived in its cities.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_25" data-id="K217_25">It happened at the beginning of their residence there that they did not honor Yahweh. So Yahweh sent lions among them which killed some of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_26" data-id="K217_26">So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, "The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the practices required by  the god of the land. So he has sent lions among them, and, see, the lions are killing people there because they do not know the practices required by the god of the land."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_27" data-id="K217_27">Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, "Take one of the priests there whom you brought from there, and let him go and live there, and let him teach them the practices required by the god of the land."</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_28" data-id="K217_28">So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and lived in Bethel; he taught them how they should honor Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_29" data-id="K217_29">Every ethnic group made gods of their own, and put them in the shrines that the Samaritans had made - every ethnic group in the cities where they lived.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_30" data-id="K217_30">The people of Babylon made Succoth Benoth; the people of Cuth made Nergal; the people of Hamath made Ashima;</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_31" data-id="K217_31">the Awites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of the Sepharvites.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_32" data-id="K217_32">They also honored Yahweh, and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places, who sacrificed for them in the temples at the shrines.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_33" data-id="K217_33">They honored Yahweh and also worshiped their own gods, in the customs of the nations from among whom they had been taken away.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_34" data-id="K217_34">To this day they persist in their old customs. They neither honor Yahweh, nor do they follow the statutes, decrees, the law, or the commandments that Yahweh gave to the people of Jacobâ€”whom he named Israel- </span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_35" data-id="K217_35">and with whom Yahweh had made a covenant and commanded them, "You will not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor worship them, nor sacrifice to them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_36" data-id="K217_36">But Yahweh, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and a  raised arm, is the one you must honor; it is to him that you will prostrate yourselves, and it is to him that will you sacrifice.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_37" data-id="K217_37">The statutes and the decrees, the law and the commandments that he wrote for you, you will keep them forever. So you must not fear other gods,</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_38" data-id="K217_38">and the covenant that I have made with you, you will not forget; neither will you honor other gods.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_39" data-id="K217_39">But Yahweh your God is who you will honor. He will rescue you from the might of your enemies."</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_40" data-id="K217_40">They would not listen, because they continued to do what they had done in the past.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v K217_41" data-id="K217_41">So these nations feared Yahweh and they also worshiped their carved figures, and their children did the sameâ€”as did their children's children. They continue to do what their ancestors did, up to this day. </span>

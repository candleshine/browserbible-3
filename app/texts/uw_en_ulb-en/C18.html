<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_1" data-id="C18_1">Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that "we all have knowledge." Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_2" data-id="C18_2">If anyone thinks he knows something, that person does not yet know as he should know.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_3" data-id="C18_3">But if anyone loves God, that person is known by him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_4" data-id="C18_4">So about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that "an idol in this world is nothing," and that "there is no God but one."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_5" data-id="C18_5">For there are many so-called gods in heaven or on earth, just as there are many "gods and lords."  </span>

<span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">"Yet for us there is only one God the Father, </span>

<span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">from him are all things, and for whom we live, </span>

<div class="q">
<span class="v C18_6" data-id="C18_6">and one Lord Jesus Christ, </span>

<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_7" data-id="C18_7">However, this knowledge is not in everyone. Instead, some previously practiced idol worship, and they eat this food as if it were something sacrificed to an idol. Their conscience is thereby corrupted because it is weak. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_8" data-id="C18_8">But food will not recommend us to God. We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it. </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_9" data-id="C18_9">But take care that your freedom does not become a reason for someone who is weak in faith to stumble.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_10" data-id="C18_10">For suppose that someone sees you, who have knowledge, eating a meal in an idol's temple. Is not his weak conscience emboldened to eat what is offered to idols?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_11" data-id="C18_11">So because of your understanding about the true nature of idols, the weaker brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_12" data-id="C18_12">Thus, when you sin against your brothers and sisters and wound their weak consciences, you sin against Christ. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C18_13" data-id="C18_13">Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause my brother or sister to fall.</span>

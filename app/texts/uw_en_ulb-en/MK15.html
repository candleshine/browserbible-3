<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_1" data-id="MK15_1">Early in the morning the chief priests met together with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. Then they bound Jesus and led him away. They handed him over to Pilate.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_2" data-id="MK15_2">Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "You say so."</span>

<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_5" data-id="MK15_5">But Jesus no longer answered Pilate, and that amazed him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_10" data-id="MK15_10">For he knew that it was because of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_11" data-id="MK15_11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to cry out that Barabbas should be released instead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK15_12" data-id="MK15_12">Pilate answered them again and said, "What then should I do with the King of the Jews?"</span>

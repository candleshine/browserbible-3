<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">Once again I thought about all the oppression that is done under the sun.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">Look at the tears of oppressed people. </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">There is no comforter for them. </span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">Power is in the hand of their oppressors, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_1" data-id="EC4_1">but oppressed people have no comforter.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">So I congratulate dead people, those who have already died, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_2" data-id="EC4_2">not the living, those who are still alive.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">However, more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_3" data-id="EC4_3">the one who has not seen any of the evil acts that are done under the sun.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_4" data-id="EC4_4">Then I saw that every act of labor and every skillful work became the envy of one's neighbor. This also is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">The fool folds his hands and does not work, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_5" data-id="EC4_5">so his food is his own flesh.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">But better is a handful of profit with quiet work</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_6" data-id="EC4_6">than two handfuls with the work that tries to shepherd the wind.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_7" data-id="EC4_7">Then I thought again about more futility, more vanishing vapor under the sun.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There is the kind of man who is alone. </span>

<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">He does not have anyone, no son or brother. </span>

<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">There is no end to all his work, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">and his eyes are not satisfied with gaining wealth. </span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">He wonders, "For whom am I toiling </span>

<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">and depriving myself of pleasure?" </span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v EC4_8" data-id="EC4_8">This also is vapor, a bad situation.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">For if one falls, the other can lift up his friend. </span>

<span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">However, sorrow follows the one who is alone when he falls </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_10" data-id="EC4_10">if there is no one to lift him up.</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">And if two lie down together, they can be warm, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_11" data-id="EC4_11">but how can one be warm alone?</span>
</div>
<div class="q1">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">One man alone can be overpowered, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">but two can withstand an attack.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v EC4_12" data-id="EC4_12">and a three-strand rope is not quickly broken.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_13" data-id="EC4_13">It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to listen to warnings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_14" data-id="EC4_14">This is true even if the young man becomes king from prison, or even if he was born poor in his kingdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_15" data-id="EC4_15">However, I saw everyone who was alive and walking around  under the sun submitting themselves to another young man who rose up as king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v EC4_16" data-id="EC4_16">There is no end to all the people who want to obey the new king, but later many of them will no longer praise him. Surely this situation is vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind.</span>

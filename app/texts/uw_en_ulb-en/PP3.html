<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_1" data-id="PP3_1">Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.  For me to write these same things again to you is not a problem, and they will keep you safe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_2" data-id="PP3_2">Watch out for the dogs. Watch out for the evil workers. Watch out for the mutilators.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_3" data-id="PP3_3">For we are the true circumcision, we who worship in the Spirit of God, glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_4" data-id="PP3_4">Even so, I myself could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_5" data-id="PP3_5">I was circumcised on the eighth day, born of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in respect to the law, a Pharisee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_6" data-id="PP3_6">I zealously persecuted the church and was blameless in respect to the righteousness of the law. </span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_7" data-id="PP3_7">But whatever things seemed to count to my credit, I have counted them as worthless because of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_8" data-id="PP3_8">In fact, now I count all things to be loss because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord. For him I have discarded all things. I consider them garbage so that I may gain Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_9" data-id="PP3_9">And now I am found in him. I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law. Instead, I have the righteousness from God that is through faith in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_10" data-id="PP3_10">So now I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferingsâ€”and I am transformed by Christ into the likeness of his death,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_11" data-id="PP3_11">so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_12" data-id="PP3_12">I have not yet received these things, so I am not yet complete. But I continue pressing on in order that I may grasp that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_13" data-id="PP3_13">Brothers, I do not think that I myself have yet grasped it.  But one thing I do is this: I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_14" data-id="PP3_14">I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_15" data-id="PP3_15">Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will also reveal that to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_16" data-id="PP3_16">However, whatever standard we have reached, let us walk in an orderly fashion according to it.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_17" data-id="PP3_17">Brothers, join me and imitate me, and watch closely those who are walking by our example.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_18" data-id="PP3_18">I have often told you, and tell you now with tears, that many are living as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_19" data-id="PP3_19">Their destiny is destruction because their god is their belly and their glory is in their shame. They are thinking about earthly things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_20" data-id="PP3_20">But our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP3_21" data-id="PP3_21">He will transform our lowly bodies into bodies formed like his glorious body, formed by his power to control all things.</span>

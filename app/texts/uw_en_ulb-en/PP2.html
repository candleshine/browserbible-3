<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_1" data-id="PP2_1">If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_2" data-id="PP2_2">make my joy full so that you are of the same mind, have the same love, are united in spirit, and have the same purpose.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_3" data-id="PP2_3">Do nothing out of selfishness or empty conceit, but instead with humility count others better than yourself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_4" data-id="PP2_4">Do not look out only for your own needs, but also look out for the needs of others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_5" data-id="PP2_5">Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,</span>

<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">who existed in the form of God.</span>

<span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">But he did not consider his equality with God </span>

<div class="q3">
<span class="v PP2_6" data-id="PP2_6">as something to hold on to.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">But instead he emptied himself. </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">He took the form of a servant. </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">He appeared in the likeness of men. </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v PP2_7" data-id="PP2_7">He was found in appearance as a man.</span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_8" data-id="PP2_8">He humbled himself and obeyed to the point of death, </span>

<span class="v PP2_8" data-id="PP2_8">even the death of the cross.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_9" data-id="PP2_9">Therefore also God highly exalted him, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v PP2_9" data-id="PP2_9">and gave him the name above every name.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_10" data-id="PP2_10">So at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, </span>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_11" data-id="PP2_11">And every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, </span>
</div>
<div class="q2">
<span class="v PP2_11" data-id="PP2_11">to the glory of God the Father.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_12" data-id="PP2_12">So then, my beloved, even as you always obey, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_13" data-id="PP2_13">For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_14" data-id="PP2_14">Do everything without complaining and arguing,</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_15" data-id="PP2_15">so that you may become blameless and honest children of God without blemish, and shine as lights in the world in the middle of a crooked and depraved generation. </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_16" data-id="PP2_16">Hold tightly to the word of life so that I may have reason to glory in the day of Christ, because then I will know that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_17" data-id="PP2_17">But even if my life is poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with great joy with you all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_18" data-id="PP2_18">And in the same manner you also must rejoice with great joy with me.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_19" data-id="PP2_19">But I expect in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that his report may also encourage me when I know how you are doing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_20" data-id="PP2_20">I have no one like Timothy who will truly care for you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_21" data-id="PP2_21">For they all seek their own interests, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_22" data-id="PP2_22">But you know Timothy has proven himself, because as a child serves his father, so he served with me in the spread of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_23" data-id="PP2_23">Therefore I expect to send him as soon as I see how things will go with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_24" data-id="PP2_24">But I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_25" data-id="PP2_25">I think it necessary to send Epaphroditus back to you. He is my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_26" data-id="PP2_26">Because you heard he was sick, he was deeply distressed and longed to be with you all. </span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_27" data-id="PP2_27">For indeed he was so sick he almost died, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_28" data-id="PP2_28">Therefore I am eager to send him so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I will not worry so much.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_29" data-id="PP2_29">Welcome Epaphroditus in the Lord with all joy, and honor him as people like him deserve,</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v PP2_30" data-id="PP2_30">because he almost died doing the work of Christ, as he risked his life to serve me and supply my needs in place of you who could not do it.</span>

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_4" data-id="NH8_4">And Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform which the people had made for the purpose. Standing beside him were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right side; and , Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam, were standing on his left side.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_5" data-id="NH8_5">Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above the people, and when he opened it all the people stood up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_6" data-id="NH8_6">Ezra gave thanks to Yahweh, the great God, and all the people lifted up their hands and answered, "Amen!, Amen!" Then they bowed their heads and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_7" data-id="NH8_7">Also Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites helped the people understand the law, while the people remained in their place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_8" data-id="NH8_8">And they read in the book, the law of God, making it clear with interpretation and giving the meaning so they understood the reading. </span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_9" data-id="NH8_9">Nehemiah the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were interpreting to the people said to all the people, "This day is holy to Yahweh your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_10" data-id="NH8_10">Then Nehemiah said to them, "Go your way, eat the fat and have  something sweet to drink, and send some of it to one who has nothing prepared, for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not be grieved, for the joy of Yahweh is your strength."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_11" data-id="NH8_11">So the Levites made the people be quiet saying, "Hush! for this day is holy. Do not be grieved." </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_12" data-id="NH8_12">And all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to share food and to celebrate with great joy because they had understood the words that were made known to them.</span>

<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_15" data-id="NH8_15">They should make a proclamation in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, "Go out into the hill country, and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtle, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters," as it is written.</span>

<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NH8_17" data-id="NH8_17">And all the assembly of those who had returned from captivity made tents and lived in them.

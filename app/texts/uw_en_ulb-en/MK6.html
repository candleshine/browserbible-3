<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_1" data-id="MK6_1">Jesus went out from there and came into his home town, and his disciples followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_2" data-id="MK6_2">When the Sabbath day came, he taught them in the synagogue. Many who heard him were shocked. They said, "Where did he get these teachings?" "What is this wisdom that God gave him?"  "What are these miracles he does with his hands?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_3" data-id="MK6_3">Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?" And they took offense at Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_4" data-id="MK6_4">Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his home town and among his own relatives, and in his own household."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_5" data-id="MK6_5">He was not able to do any mighty deed there, except he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_6" data-id="MK6_6">Their unbelief amazed him. He went around their villages teaching. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_7" data-id="MK6_7">He called the Twelve to him and sent them out, two by two; he gave them authority over the unclean spirits,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_8" data-id="MK6_8">and he instructed them to take nothing for their journey but a staff. They should take no bread, no beggar's bag, and no money in their belts,</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_9" data-id="MK6_9">but to wear sandals, and not to wear two tunics.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_10" data-id="MK6_10">He said, "Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_11" data-id="MK6_11">If any place will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave that place, shake off the dust that is under your feet, for a testimony against them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_12" data-id="MK6_12">They went out and proclaimed that people should turn away from their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_13" data-id="MK6_13">They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil and healed many sick people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_14" data-id="MK6_14">King Herod heard this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist had been raised from the dead and on account of this, these miraculous powers are at work in him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_15" data-id="MK6_15">Some others said, "He is Elijah." Still others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets in ancient times." </span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_16" data-id="MK6_16">But when Herod heard this he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_17" data-id="MK6_17">For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison, because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because Herod had married her.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_18" data-id="MK6_18">For John told Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_19" data-id="MK6_19">Herodias set herself against John and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_20" data-id="MK6_20">for Herod feared John, and he knew that he was a righteous and holy man. So Herod tried to keep him safe. When he heard John preach, his message upset him, and yet he was still glad to hear him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_21" data-id="MK6_21">But a day came that was an opportunity for Herodias to act: on his birthday Herod made a dinner for his officials, his commanders, and the leaders of Galilee.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_22" data-id="MK6_22">The daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced for them, and she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want and I will give it to you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_23" data-id="MK6_23">He swore to her saying, "Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_24" data-id="MK6_24">She went out and said to her mother, "What should I ask him for?" She said, "The head of John the Baptist."</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_25" data-id="MK6_25">She hurried back in the hall to the king and asked him, "I want you to give me at once, upon a platter, the head of John the Baptist."</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_26" data-id="MK6_26">The king became very sorry, but because of his oaths, and for his guests, he could not refuse her request.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_27" data-id="MK6_27">So the king sent a soldier from his guard and commanded him to bring him John's head. The guard went and beheaded him in the prison.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_28" data-id="MK6_28">He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_29" data-id="MK6_29">Hearing this, his disciples came and took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_30" data-id="MK6_30">The apostles gathered together around Jesus, and they told him all that they had done and taught.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_31" data-id="MK6_31">He said to them, "Come away by yourselves into a deserted place and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they took no time apart for leisure, not even time to eat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_32" data-id="MK6_32">They went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_33" data-id="MK6_33">But many people saw them leave and they recognized them. They ran there together on foot from all the towns, and they arrived there before them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_34" data-id="MK6_34">When he came ashore, Jesus saw a great crowd; he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_35" data-id="MK6_35">When the hour was late, his disciples came to him and said, "This a deserted place and the hour is already late.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_36" data-id="MK6_36">Dismiss them that they may go into the nearby countryside and into the villages and buy something to eat for themselves."</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_37" data-id="MK6_37">But he answered and said to them, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "Can we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_38" data-id="MK6_38">He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five loaves and two fish."</span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_39" data-id="MK6_39">He commanded all the people to sit down in groups upon the green grass.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_40" data-id="MK6_40">They sat down in groups; groups of hundreds and fifties.</span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_41" data-id="MK6_41">As he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. The two fish he divided among them all.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_42" data-id="MK6_42">They all ate and until they were satisfied.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_43" data-id="MK6_43">They took up broken pieces of bread, twelve baskets full, and also pieces of the fish.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_44" data-id="MK6_44">Now there were five thousand men who ate the loaves.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_45" data-id="MK6_45">Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself should send the crowd away. </span>
<span class="v-num v-46">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_46" data-id="MK6_46">When they had gone, he then went up on the mountain to pray.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_47" data-id="MK6_47">Evening came, and the boat was now in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_48" data-id="MK6_48">He saw that they were straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the lake, and he wanted to pass by them,</span>
<span class="v-num v-49">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_49" data-id="MK6_49">but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost and they cried out,</span>
<span class="v-num v-50">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_50" data-id="MK6_50">for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, "Be brave! It is I! Be not afraid."</span>
<span class="v-num v-51">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_51" data-id="MK6_51">He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased blowing; and they were completely amazed at him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_52" data-id="MK6_52">For they did not understood about the loaves, but their minds were slow to understand.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-53">53&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_53" data-id="MK6_53">When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.</span>
<span class="v-num v-54">54&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_54" data-id="MK6_54">When they came out of the boat, people immediately recognized it was Jesus. </span>
<span class="v-num v-55">55&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_55" data-id="MK6_55">The people ran through the whole region and began to bring the sick on stretchers to him, wherever they heard he was coming.</span>
<span class="v-num v-56">56&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK6_56" data-id="MK6_56">Wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or into the country, they would put the sick in the marketplaces, and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe of his garment, and as many as touched it were healed.</span>

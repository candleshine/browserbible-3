<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_1" data-id="HB6_1">So then, leaving what we first learned about the message of Christ, we must press on to maturity, not again laying out the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_2" data-id="HB6_2">nor the foundation of teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_3" data-id="HB6_3">We will also do these things if God permits.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_4" data-id="HB6_4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who were sharers of the Holy Spirit,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_5" data-id="HB6_5">and who tasted God's good word and the powers of the age to come,</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_6" data-id="HB6_6">and who then fell awayâ€”it is impossible to restore them again to repentance. This is  because they have crucified for themselves the very Son of God again, making him an object of public ridicule.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_7" data-id="HB6_7">For the land that has received the rain that often falls on it, and that produces a crop useful for those who worked the land, receives a blessing from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_8" data-id="HB6_8">But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and is in danger of being cursed.  Its end comes in burning.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_9" data-id="HB6_9">Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things concerning you and things that are about salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_10" data-id="HB6_10">For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love that you have shown for his name, in that you served the believers and still do serve them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_11" data-id="HB6_11">And we greatly desire that each of you may show the same diligence to the very end with full assurance of confidence.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_12" data-id="HB6_12">We do not want you to become  sluggish, but rather that you be imitators of those who  inherit the promises because of faith and patience.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_13" data-id="HB6_13">For when God made his promise to Abraham,  he swore by himself, since he could not swear by anyone greater.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_14" data-id="HB6_14">He said, "I will certainly bless you, and I will greatly increase your descendants."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_15" data-id="HB6_15">In this way, Abraham obtained what was  promised after he had patiently waited.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_16" data-id="HB6_16">For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and in every dispute of theirs an oath is final for confirmation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_17" data-id="HB6_17">When God decided to show more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable quality of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_18" data-id="HB6_18">He did this so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge may have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the confidence that is set before us.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_19" data-id="HB6_19">We have this confidence as a secure and reliable anchor of our souls, confidence that enters into the inner place behind the curtain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB6_20" data-id="HB6_20">Jesus entered into that place as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. ng</span>

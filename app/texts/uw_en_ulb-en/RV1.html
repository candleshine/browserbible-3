<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_5" data-id="RV1_5">and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has released us from our sins by his blood,</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_9" data-id="RV1_9">I, John—your brother and the one who shares with you in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are in Jesus—was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_10" data-id="RV1_10">I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day. I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_11" data-id="RV1_11">It said, "Write in a book what you see, and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_12" data-id="RV1_12">I turned around to see whose voice was speaking to me, and as I turned I saw seven golden lampstands.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_13" data-id="RV1_13">In the middle of the lampstands there was one like a Son of Man, wearing a long robe that reached down to his feet, and a golden belt around his chest.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_14" data-id="RV1_14">His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_15" data-id="RV1_15">His feet were like burnished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many rushing waters.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_16" data-id="RV1_16">He had in his right hand seven stars, and coming out of his mouth was a sharp two-edged sword. His face was shining like the sun at its strongest shining.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_17" data-id="RV1_17">When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He placed his right hand on me and said, "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_18" data-id="RV1_18">and the one who lives. I was dead, but look, I live forever! And I have the keys of death and of hades.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_19" data-id="RV1_19">Therefore write down what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV1_20" data-id="RV1_20">As for the hidden meaning about the seven stars you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."</span>

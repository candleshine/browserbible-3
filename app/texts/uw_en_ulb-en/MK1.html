<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_4" data-id="MK1_4">As John came, he was baptizing in the wilderness and was preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_5" data-id="MK1_5">All the country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him. They were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_6" data-id="MK1_6">John wore a coat of camel's hair, he had a leather belt about his waist, and he was eating locusts and wild honey.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_7" data-id="MK1_7">He preached and said, "Someone is coming after me who is more powerful than I, and I am not worthy even to stoop down to untie the strap of his sandals.</span>

<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_9" data-id="MK1_9">It happened in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and he was baptized by John in the Jordan River.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_10" data-id="MK1_10">As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down on him like a dove,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_11" data-id="MK1_11">while a voice came out of the heavens, "You are my beloved Son. I am very pleased with you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_12" data-id="MK1_12">Then the Spirit immediately compelled him to go out into the wilderness. </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_13" data-id="MK1_13">He was in the wilderness forty days, and he was being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels served his needs.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_14" data-id="MK1_14">Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God, </span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_15" data-id="MK1_15">and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe in the gospel."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_16" data-id="MK1_16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_17" data-id="MK1_17">Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men." </span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_18" data-id="MK1_18">Immediately they left the nets and went after him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_19" data-id="MK1_19">As Jesus was walking on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother; they were in the boat mending the nets. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_20" data-id="MK1_20">He immediately called them; they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and they followed him. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_21" data-id="MK1_21">And going into Capernaum, immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught. </span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_22" data-id="MK1_22">They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one with authority and not as the scribes. </span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_23" data-id="MK1_23">Just then there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. He cried out, </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_24" data-id="MK1_24">"What do we have to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!" </span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_25" data-id="MK1_25">Jesus rebuked the demon and said, "Be quiet and come out of him!" </span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_26" data-id="MK1_26">After the unclean spirit had thrown him down, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_27" data-id="MK1_27">The people were all amazed, so they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him." </span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_28" data-id="MK1_28">Immediately the news about him went out everywhere into all the region surrounding Galilee.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_29" data-id="MK1_29">Immediately after they left the synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_30" data-id="MK1_30">Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever. Immediately they told Jesus about her. </span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_31" data-id="MK1_31">So he came, took hold of her by the hand, and raised her up; the fever left her, and she started serving them.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_32" data-id="MK1_32">When it was evening, after the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed by demons. </span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_33" data-id="MK1_33">The whole city gathered together at the door. </span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_34" data-id="MK1_34">He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak because they knew him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_35" data-id="MK1_35">He got up very early while it was still dark; he left and went out into a solitary place, and he prayed there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_36" data-id="MK1_36">Simon and those who were with him searched for him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_37" data-id="MK1_37">They found him, and they said to him, "Everyone is looking for you." </span>
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_38" data-id="MK1_38">He said, "Let us go elsewhere, out into the surrounding towns, that I may preach there also. That is what I came out here to do." </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_39" data-id="MK1_39">He went throughout all Galilee, he preached in their synagogues and he casted out demons.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_40" data-id="MK1_40">A leper came to him; he was begging him as he knelt down. He said to him, "If you are willing, you can make me clean." </span>
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_41" data-id="MK1_41">Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying to him, "I am willing. Be clean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_42" data-id="MK1_42">Immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. </span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_43" data-id="MK1_43">Jesus strictly warned him and sent him away immediately, </span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_44" data-id="MK1_44">Jesus said to him, "Be sure to say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the things for your cleansing that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-45">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK1_45" data-id="MK1_45">But he went out and started to tell everyone. The man spread the word so much that Jesus was unable to go freely into any town; he had to stay out in desert places so that people had to go out to him from everywhere.</span>

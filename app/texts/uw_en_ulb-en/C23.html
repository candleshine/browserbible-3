<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_1" data-id="C23_1">Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? We do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, like some people, do we?</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_2" data-id="C23_2">You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, known and read by all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_3" data-id="C23_3">And you show that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us. It was written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God. It was not written on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_4" data-id="C23_4">And this is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_5" data-id="C23_5">We are not competent in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us. Instead, our adequacy is from God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_6" data-id="C23_6">It is God who made us able to be servants of a new covenant. This is a covenant not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_7" data-id="C23_7">Now the work of death that was engraved in letters on stones came in such glory that the people of Israel could not look directly at Moses' face. This is because of the glory of his face, a glory that was fading.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_8" data-id="C23_8">Will not the work of the Spirit be even more glorious?</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_9" data-id="C23_9">For if the work of condemnation had glory, how much more does the service of righteousness abound in glory!</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_10" data-id="C23_10">For indeed, that which was once made glorious is no longer glorious in this respect, because of the glory that exceeds it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_11" data-id="C23_11">For if that which was passing away had glory, how much more will what is permanent have glory!</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_12" data-id="C23_12">Since we have such confidence, we are very bold.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_13" data-id="C23_13">We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face, so that the people of Israel were not able to look directly at the ending of a glory that was passing away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_14" data-id="C23_14">But their minds were closed. Even until this very day the same veil remains on the reading of the old covenant. It is not opened up, because only in Christ is it done away with.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_15" data-id="C23_15">But even today, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_16" data-id="C23_16">But when a person turns to the Lord, the veil is lifted away.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_17" data-id="C23_17">Now the Lord is the Spirit. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C23_18" data-id="C23_18">Now all of us, with unveiled faces, see the glory of the Lord. We are being transformed into the same glorious likeness from one degree of glory into another, just as this is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_1" data-id="ET5_1">After three days, Esther put on her royal clothes and went to stand in the inner courtyard of the king's palace, in front of the king's house. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the royal house, facing the entrance to the house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_2" data-id="ET5_2">When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, she won favor in his sight. He held out to her the golden scepter in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_3" data-id="ET5_3">Then the king said to her, "What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? Up to half of my kingdom, it will be given to you." </span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_4" data-id="ET5_4">Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to a feast that I have prepared for him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_5" data-id="ET5_5">Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, to do what Esther has said." So the king and Haman went to the feast that Esther had prepared.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_6" data-id="ET5_6">When the wine was being served at the feast, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition? It will be granted you. What is your request? Up to half of the kingdom, it will be granted."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_7" data-id="ET5_7">Esther answered, "My petition and my request is this,</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_8" data-id="ET5_8">if I have found favor in the eyes of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to honor my request. Let the king and Haman come to the feast that I will prepare for you tomorrow, and I will answer the king's question."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_9" data-id="ET5_9">Haman went out that day joyful and glad at heart. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, that Mordecai neither rose up nor trembled before him with any fear, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_10" data-id="ET5_10">Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went to his own house. He sent for his friends and gathered them together, with Zeresh his wife.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_11" data-id="ET5_11">Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches and the number of his many sons, how he had advanced above all the officials and the servants of the king. </span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_12" data-id="ET5_12">Haman said, "Even Queen Esther invited no one else but me to come with the king to the feast she prepared. And even tomorrow I am again invited by her to be together with the king.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_13" data-id="ET5_13">But all this that I am experiencing is worth nothing to me, as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v ET5_14" data-id="ET5_14">Then Zeresh his wife said to Haman and all his friends, "Let them make a gallows fifty cubits high. In the morning speak to the king for them to hang Mordecai on it. Then go joyfully with the king to the feast." This pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed.</span>

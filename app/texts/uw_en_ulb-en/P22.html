<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_3" data-id="P22_3">They will greedily make a profit off of you with deceptive words. Against them condemnation will not wait long; their destruction is not idle.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_4" data-id="P22_4">For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but instead handed them down to Tartarus, to be kept in chains in deep darkness until the judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_5" data-id="P22_5">For if he did not spare the ancient world, but did preserve Noah, who was a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, but brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly, </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_6" data-id="P22_6">and reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes and condemned them to destruction as an example of what is to come to the ungodly.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_7" data-id="P22_7">And he rescued righteous Lot, who was greatly distressed by the filthy behavior of lawless men. </span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_8" data-id="P22_8">For that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormenting his righteous soul because of what he saw and heard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_9" data-id="P22_9">The Lord knows how to rescue godly men out of trials, and how to hold unrighteous men for punishment at the day of judgment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_10" data-id="P22_10">This is especially true for those who continue in the corrupt desires of the flesh and despise authority. They are bold and self-willed. They are not afraid to blaspheme the glorious ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_11" data-id="P22_11">Angels have greater strength and ability than all men, but they do not bring insulting judgments against them to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_12" data-id="P22_12">But these mindless animals are naturally made for capture and destruction. They do not know what they insult. They will be destroyed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_13" data-id="P22_13">They are harmed by the reward of their wrongdoing. They live in pleasure during the day. They are stains and blemishes. They enjoy their deceitful pleasures while they feast with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_14" data-id="P22_14">They have eyes full of adulterous women; they are never satisfied with sin. They entice unstable souls into wrongdoing, and they have their hearts trained in covetousness, cursed children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_15" data-id="P22_15">They have abandoned the right way. They went astray and they have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved to receive payment for unrighteousness.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_16" data-id="P22_16">But he obtained a rebuke for his own transgression. A mute donkey speaking in a human voice stopped the prophet's insanity.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_17" data-id="P22_17">These men are like springs without water. They are like clouds that a storm drives. Thick darkness is reserved for them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_18" data-id="P22_18">They speak with vain arrogance. They entice people through the lusts of the flesh. They entice people who try to escape from those who live in error.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v P22_19" data-id="P22_19">They promise freedom to them, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For a man is a slave to whatever overcomes him.</span>

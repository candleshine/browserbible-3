<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_8" data-id="S223_8">These are the names of David's elite soldiers: Jeshbaal, the Hachmonite, was the leader of the elite soldiers. He killed eight hundred men on one occasion.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_9" data-id="S223_9">After him was Eleazar son of Dodo, son of an Ahohite, one of the three mighty men of David. He was present when they defied the Philistines who had gathered together to do battle, and when the men of Israel had retreated.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_10" data-id="S223_10">Eleazar stood and fought the Philistines until his hand became weary and his hand stiffened to the grip of his sword. Yahweh brought about a great victory that day. The army returned after Eleazar, only to strip the bodies.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_11" data-id="S223_11">After him was Shammah the son of Agee, a Hararite. The Philistines gathered together where there was a field of lentils, and the army fled from them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_12" data-id="S223_12">But Shammah stood in the middle of the field and defended it. He killed the Philistines, and Yahweh brought about a great victory.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_13" data-id="S223_13">Three of the thirty soldiers went down to David at harvest time, to the cave of Adullam. The army of the Philistines was camped in the valley of Rephaim.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_14" data-id="S223_14">At that time David was in his stronghold, a cave, while the Philistines had established at Bethlehem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_15" data-id="S223_15">David was longing for water and said, "If only someone would give me water to drink from the well at Bethlehem, the well that is by the gate!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_16" data-id="S223_16">So these three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, the well at the gate. They took the water and brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_17" data-id="S223_17">Then he said, "Far be it far from me, Yahweh, that I should drink this. Should I drink the blood of men who have risked their lives?" So he refused to drink it. </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v S223_17" data-id="S223_17">These are things the three mighty men did.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_18" data-id="S223_18">Abishai, brother of Joab and son of Zeruiah, was captain over the three. He once fought with his spear against three hundred men and killed them. He was often mentioned along with the three soldiers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_19" data-id="S223_19">Was he not even more famous than the three? He was made their captain. However, his fame did not equal the fame of the three most famous  soldiers.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_20" data-id="S223_20">Benaiah from Kabzeel was the son of Jehoiada; he was a strong man who did mighty feats. He killed the two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion while it was snowing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_21" data-id="S223_21">And he killed a very large Egyptian man. The  Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah fought against him with only a staff. He wrested the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and then killed him with his own spear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_22" data-id="S223_22">Benaiah son of Jehoiada did these feats, and he was named alongside the three mighty men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v S223_23" data-id="S223_23">He was more highly regarded than the thirty soldiers in general, but he was not regarded quite as highly as the three most elite soldiers. Yet David put him in charge of his bodyguard.</span>

<div class="c">2</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_1" data-id="HB2_1">Therefore we must give far more attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_2" data-id="HB2_2">For if the message that was spoken through the angels is valid, and every transgression and disobedience receives just punishment.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_3" data-id="HB2_3">How then can we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?—salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_4" data-id="HB2_4">God also testified to it by signs, wonders, and by various powerful deeds, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit which he distributed according to his own will.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_5" data-id="HB2_5">God did not put the world to come, about which we are speaking, under the angels.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">Instead, someone has somewhere testified and said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">"What is man, that you are mindful of him?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_6" data-id="HB2_6">Or the son of man, that you care for him?</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_7" data-id="HB2_7">You made man a little lower than the angels;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_7" data-id="HB2_7">you crowned him with glory and honor.</span>
<span class="note" id="note-1"><a class="key" href="#footnote-1">1</a><span class="text"> Some manuscripts add: "...and you have put him over the works of your hands."</span></span></div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_8" data-id="HB2_8">You put everything in subjection under his feet."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB2_8" data-id="HB2_8">For God has subjected everything to mankind. He did not leave anything not subject to him. But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_9" data-id="HB2_9">However, we do see the one who was made for a little while, lower than the angels—Jesus, who, because of his suffering and death, has been crowned with glory and honor.  So now by God's grace, Jesus has tasted death for every man.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_10" data-id="HB2_10">It was proper that God, because everything exists for him and through him, should bring many sons to glory, and that he should make the leader in their salvation complete through his sufferings.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_11" data-id="HB2_11">For both the one who dedicates and those who are dedicated, all come from one source, God. For this reason the one who dedicates them to God is not ashamed to call them brothers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">he says,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">"I will proclaim your name to my brothers;</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_12" data-id="HB2_12">I will sing about you from inside the assembly."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">And again he says, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">"I will trust in him." </span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">And again, </span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v HB2_13" data-id="HB2_13">"See, here am I and the children whom God has given me."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_14" data-id="HB2_14">Therefore, since the children of God all share flesh and blood, Jesus also shared the same things, so that through death he might make ineffective the one who had the power of death, that is to say, the devil.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_15" data-id="HB2_15">This was so he might free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_16" data-id="HB2_16">For surely it is not the angels that he is helping; instead, he is helping Abraham's descendants.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_17" data-id="HB2_17">Therefore it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest over God's things, and so that he might achieve forgiveness for the people's sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v HB2_18" data-id="HB2_18">Because Jesus himself has suffered, having been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span>

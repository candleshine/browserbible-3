<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_1" data-id="MK12_1">Then Jesus began to teach them in parables. He said, "A man planted a vineyard, set a fence around it, and dug a pit for a winepress. He built a watchtower and then leased the vineyard to vine growers. Then he went away on a journey.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_2" data-id="MK12_2">At the right time, he sent a servant to the vine growers to receive from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_3" data-id="MK12_3">But they took him, beat him, and sent him away with nothing.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_4" data-id="MK12_4">Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head and treated him shamefully.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_5" data-id="MK12_5">He sent yet another, and this one they killed. They treated many others in the same way, beating some and and killing others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_6" data-id="MK12_6">He had still one more person to send, a beloved son. He was the last one he sent to them. He said, "They will respect my son."</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_7" data-id="MK12_7">But the tenants said to one another, "This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_8" data-id="MK12_8">They seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_9" data-id="MK12_9">Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vine growers and will give the vineyard to others.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_10" data-id="MK12_10">Have you not read this scripture?</span>

<span class="v MK12_10" data-id="MK12_10">'The stone which the builders rejected,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK12_10" data-id="MK12_10">has been made the cornerstone.</span>
</div>

<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_11" data-id="MK12_11">This was from the Lord,</span>

<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_12" data-id="MK12_12">They sought to arrest Jesus, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that he has spoken this parable against them. So they left him and went away.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_13" data-id="MK12_13">Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to entrap him in speaking.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_14" data-id="MK12_14">When they came, they said to him, "Teacher, we know that you care for no one's opinion, and you do not show partiality between people. You truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or not?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_15" data-id="MK12_15">But Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius so I can look at it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_16" data-id="MK12_16">They brought one to Jesus. He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" They said, "Caesar's."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_17" data-id="MK12_17">Jesus said, "Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God, the things that are God's." They marveled at him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_18" data-id="MK12_18">Then Sadducees came to him, they who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_19" data-id="MK12_19">"Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If a man's brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, but no child, the man should take the brother's wife, and have a child for his brother.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_20" data-id="MK12_20">There were seven brothers; the first took a wife and then died, leaving no children.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_21" data-id="MK12_21">Then the second took her and died, leaving no children. And the third likewise.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_22" data-id="MK12_22">And the seven left no children. Last of all the woman also died.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_23" data-id="MK12_23">In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven brothers had her as their wife."</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_24" data-id="MK12_24">Jesus said, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures nor the power of God?</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_25" data-id="MK12_25">For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor be given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_26" data-id="MK12_26">But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in The Book of Moses, in the account about the bush, how God spoke to him and said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?'"</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_27" data-id="MK12_27">He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite mistaken."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_28" data-id="MK12_28">One of the scribes came and heard their discussion; he saw that Jesus answered them well. He asked him, "What commandment is the most important of all?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_29" data-id="MK12_29">Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_30" data-id="MK12_30">You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_31" data-id="MK12_31">The second commandment is this, 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other greater commandment than these."</span>
<span class="v-num v-32">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_32" data-id="MK12_32">The scribe said, "Good, Teacher! You have truly said that God is one, and that there is no other besides him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_33" data-id="MK12_33">To love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span>
<span class="v-num v-34">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_34" data-id="MK12_34">When Jesus saw that he had given a wise answer, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-35">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_35" data-id="MK12_35">Jesus was teaching in the temple, and he responded to them and said, "How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David?</span>
<span class="v-num v-36">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_36" data-id="MK12_36">David himself, in the Holy Spirit, said,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK12_36" data-id="MK12_36">'The Lord said to my Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK12_36" data-id="MK12_36">sit at my right hand,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v MK12_36" data-id="MK12_36">until I make your enemies your footstool.'</span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-37">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_37" data-id="MK12_37">David himself calls the Christ 'Lord', so how is he David's son?" The great crowd listened to him with gladness.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-38">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_38" data-id="MK12_38">In his teaching Jesus said, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and special greetings in the marketplaces </span>
<span class="v-num v-39">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_39" data-id="MK12_39">and chief seats in the synagogues and chief places at feasts.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_40" data-id="MK12_40">They also devour widows' houses, and they pray long prayers for people to see. These will receive greater condemnation."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_41" data-id="MK12_41">Then Jesus sat down across from an offering box in the temple area; he was watching people as they dropped their money into the box. Many rich people put in large amounts of money.</span>
<span class="v-num v-42">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_42" data-id="MK12_42">Then a poor widow came and put in two mites, worth about a penny.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_43" data-id="MK12_43">Jesus called his disciples together and said to them, "Truly I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them who contributed to the offering box.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v MK12_44" data-id="MK12_44">All of these gave out of their abundance. But this widow, out of her poverty, put in all of the money which she had to live on. "</span>

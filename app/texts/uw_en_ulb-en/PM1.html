<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_1" data-id="PM1_1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother—to Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_2" data-id="PM1_2">and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow worker, and to the church that meets in your home:</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_3" data-id="PM1_3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_4" data-id="PM1_4">I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_5" data-id="PM1_5">hearing of the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus and of your love for all the believers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_6" data-id="PM1_6">I pray that the active sharing of your faith may help you grow in the knowledge of everything good that belongs to us in Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_7" data-id="PM1_7">For your love has given me much joy and comfort, because you, brother, refreshed the hearts of the believers.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_8" data-id="PM1_8">Therefore, although I have all the boldness in Christ to command you to do what you should do, </span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_9" data-id="PM1_9">yet because of love, I appeal to you instead—I, Paul, an old man, and now a prisoner for Christ Jesus—</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_10" data-id="PM1_10">I ask you concerning my child Onesimus,  whom I have fathered in my bonds.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_11" data-id="PM1_11">For he once was unprofitable to you, but now is profitable both to you and to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_12" data-id="PM1_12">I have sent him—who is my very heart—back to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_13" data-id="PM1_13">I wish I could have kept him with me, so he could serve me in your place, while I am in chains for the sake of the gospel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_14" data-id="PM1_14">But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so any good deed would not be done because I forced you, but because you wanted to do it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_15" data-id="PM1_15">Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a while, was so you might have him back forever—</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_16" data-id="PM1_16">no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother— especially to me, and how much more so to you, both in human terms and in the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_17" data-id="PM1_17">And so if you regard me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_18" data-id="PM1_18">But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_19" data-id="PM1_19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will pay you back. I do not mention to you that you owe me your very life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_20" data-id="PM1_20">Yes, brother, let me have some joy in the Lord from you; refresh my heart in Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_21" data-id="PM1_21">Confident about your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_22" data-id="PM1_22">At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will soon be able to visit you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_23" data-id="PM1_23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_24" data-id="PM1_24">and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v PM1_25" data-id="PM1_25">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</span>

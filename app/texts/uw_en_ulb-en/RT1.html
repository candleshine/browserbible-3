<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_1" data-id="RT1_1">It happened in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem of Judah went to the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_2" data-id="RT1_2">The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi. The name of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem of Judah. They arrived at the country of Moab and lived there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_3" data-id="RT1_3">Then Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_4" data-id="RT1_4">These sons took wives from the women of Moab; the name of one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there for about ten years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_5" data-id="RT1_5">Then both Mahlon and Chilion died, leaving Naomi without her husband and without her two children. </span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_6" data-id="RT1_6">Then Naomi decided to leave Moab with her daughters-in-law and return to Judah. She had heard in the region of Moab that Yahweh had helped his people in need and had given them food.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_7" data-id="RT1_7">So she left the place where she had been with her two daughters-in-law, and they walked down the road to return to the land of Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_8" data-id="RT1_8">Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return, each of you, to your mother's house. May Yahweh show loyalty toward you, as you have shown loyalty toward the dead and toward me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_9" data-id="RT1_9">May  the Lord grant you that you find rest, each of you in the house of another husband." Then she kissed them, and they raised their voices and cried.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_10" data-id="RT1_10">They said to her, "No! We will return with you to your people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_11" data-id="RT1_11">But Naomi said, "Turn back, my daughters! Why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb for you, so that they may become your husbands?</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_12" data-id="RT1_12">Turn back, my daughters, go your own way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I said, I hope I get a husband tonight and then give birth to sons, </span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_13" data-id="RT1_13">would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would you wait and not marry men now? No, my daughters! It greatly grieves me, much more than it grieves you, because the hand of Yahweh has turned against me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_14" data-id="RT1_14">Then her daughters-in-law lifted up their voices and cried again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law farewell, but Ruth held on to her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_15" data-id="RT1_15">Naomi said, "Listen, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. Go back with your sister-in-law."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_16" data-id="RT1_16">But Ruth said, "Do not make me go away from you, for where you go, I will go; where you stay, I will stay; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_17" data-id="RT1_17">Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May Yahweh punish me, and even more, if anything but death ever separates us."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_18" data-id="RT1_18">When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped arguing with her.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_19" data-id="RT1_19">So the two traveled until they came to the town of Bethlehem. It happened that when they arrived in Bethlehem, all the town was very excited about them. The women said, "Is this Naomi?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_20" data-id="RT1_20">But she said to them, "Do not call me Naomi. Call me Bitter, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_21" data-id="RT1_21">I went out full, but Yahweh has brought me home again empty. So why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has condemned me, that the Almighty has afflicted me?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RT1_22" data-id="RT1_22">So Naomi and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.</span>

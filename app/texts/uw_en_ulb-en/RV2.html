<span class="v RV2_1" data-id="RV2_1">'These are the words of the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand. The one who walks among the seven golden lampstands says this, </span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_2" data-id="RV2_2">"'I know what you have done and your hard labor and your patient endurance, and that you cannot put up with those who are evil, and you have tested those who claim themselves to be apostles, but are not, and have found them to be false.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_3" data-id="RV2_3">I know you have patient endurance, and you have gone through much because of my name, and you have not grown weary.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_4" data-id="RV2_4">But this is what I have against you—you have left behind your first love.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_5" data-id="RV2_5">Remember therefore from where you have fallen. Repent and do the things you did at first. Unless you repent, I will come to you and will remove your lampstand from its place.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_6" data-id="RV2_6">But you have this—you hate what the Nicolaitans have done, which I also hate.</span>

<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_10" data-id="RV2_10">Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Look! The devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will suffer for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span>

<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_14" data-id="RV2_14">But I have a few things against you: You have there some who hold tightly to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, so they would eat food sacrificed to idols and be sexually immoral.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_15" data-id="RV2_15">In the same way, you even have some who hold tightly to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_16" data-id="RV2_16">Repent, therefore! If you do not, I will come to you without delay, and I will make war against them with the sword that comes out of my mouth.</span>

<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_20" data-id="RV2_20">But I have this against you: You tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she deceives my servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RV2_21" data-id="RV2_21">I gave her time to repent, but she is not willing to repent of her immorality.</span>

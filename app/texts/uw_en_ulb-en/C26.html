<span class="v C26_2" data-id="C26_2">Look, now is the favorable time. Look, now is the day of salvation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_3" data-id="C26_3">We do not place a stumbling block in front of anyone, for we do not wish our ministry to be brought into disrepute.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_4" data-id="C26_4">Instead, we prove ourselves by all our actions, that we are God's servants. We are his servants in much endurance, affliction, distress, hardship,</span>

<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_8" data-id="C26_8">We work in honor and dishonor, in slander and praise. We are accused of being deceitful and yet we are truthful.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_9" data-id="C26_9">We work as if we were unknown and we are still well known. We work as dying and—see!—we are still living. We work as being punished for our actions but not as condemned to death.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C26_10" data-id="C26_10">We work as sorrowful, but we are always rejoicing. We work as poor, but we are making many rich. We work as having nothing and yet as possessing all things.</span>

<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_2" data-id="K223_2">Then the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, prophets, and all the people, from small to great. He then read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_3" data-id="K223_3">The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, covenant decrees, and statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to confirm the words of this covenant that were written in this book.

<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_4" data-id="K223_4">The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests under him, and the gatekeepers, to bring out of the temple of Yahweh all the vessels that were made for Baal and Asherah, and for all the stars of heaven. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields in the Kidron Valley and carried their ashes to Bethel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_5" data-id="K223_5">He removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had chosen to burn incense at the shrines in the cities of Judah and in the places around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and the moon, to the planets, and to all the stars of heaven.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_6" data-id="K223_6">He brought out the Asherah pole  from the temple of Yahweh, outside  Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley and burned it there. He beat it to dust and threw that dust onto the graves of the common people.</span>

He destroyed the shrines at the gates, the shrines that were at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, built by a city governor named Joshua. These shrines were to the left of the city gate as one entered the city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_9" data-id="K223_9">Even though the priests of those shrines were not allowed to serve at the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, they were allowed to eat unleavened bread, like their brother priests.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_10" data-id="K223_10">Josiah defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of Ben Hinnom, so that no one might offer his son or his daughter as a burnt offering in the fire to Molech.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_11" data-id="K223_11">He took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun.

<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_13" data-id="K223_13">Josiah defiled the shrines that were east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Corruption that Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the disgusting idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the disgusting idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the disgusting idol of the people of Ammon.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_14" data-id="K223_14">King Josiah broke into pieces the sacred stone pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and filled in their places with human bones.</span>

<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_16" data-id="K223_16">As Josiah looked over the area, he noticed the graves that were on the hillside. He sent men to take the bones from the graves; then he burned them on the altar, which defiled it. This was according to the word of Yahweh which the man of God had spoken, the man who spoke of these things beforehand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_17" data-id="K223_17">Then he said, "What monument is that I see?" The men of the city told him, "That is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah and spoke about these things that you have just done against the altar of Bethel."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_18" data-id="K223_18">So Josiah said, "Let it alone. No one should move his bones." So they let his bones alone, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_19" data-id="K223_19">All the temples and shrines that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke Yahweh to anger—Josiah took them away. He did to them exactly what had been done at Bethel.</span>

<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_22" data-id="K223_22">Such a Passover celebration had never been held from the days of the judges who ruled Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel or Judah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_23" data-id="K223_23">However, this Passover was indeed celebrated in the eighteenth year of King Josiah; it was for Yahweh in Jerusalem.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_24" data-id="K223_24">Josiah also banished those who talked with the dead or with spirits. He also banished the fetishes,  the idols, and all the disgusting things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, so as to confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of Yahweh.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_25" data-id="K223_25">Before Josiah, there had been no king like him, who turned to Yahweh with all his heart, all his soul, and all his might, who followed all the law of Moses. Nor did any king like Josiah arise after him.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_26" data-id="K223_26">However, Yahweh did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, which had been kindled against Judah for all the pagan worship with which Manasseh had provoked him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_27" data-id="K223_27">So Yahweh said, "I will also remove Judah out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and I will throw away this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, 'My name will be there.' "</span>

<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v K223_30" data-id="K223_30">Josiah's servants carried him dead in a chariot from Megiddo, brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own grave.

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_22" data-id="DT22_22">If a man is found sleeping with a woman who is married to another man, then they must both die, the man who was sleeping with the woman, and the woman herself; and you will remove the evil from among you.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_25" data-id="DT22_25">But if the man finds the engaged girl in the field, and if he seizes her and sleeps with her, then only the man who sleeps with her must die.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_26" data-id="DT22_26">But to the girl you must do nothing; there is no sin worthy of death in the girl. For this case is like when a man attacks his neighbor and kills him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v DT22_27" data-id="DT22_27">For he found her in the field; the engaged girl cried out, but there was no one to save her.</span>

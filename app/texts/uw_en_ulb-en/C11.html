<div class="mt">The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians</div>
<div class="c">1</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_1" data-id="C11_1">This is Paul, called by Christ Jesus to be an apostle by the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_2" data-id="C11_2">We are writing to the church of God at Corinth, those whom Christ Jesus has dedicated to God, who are called to be holy people. We are also writing to all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, their Lord and ours.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_3" data-id="C11_3">May grace and peace be to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_4" data-id="C11_4">I always give thanks to my God for you, because of the grace of God that Christ Jesus gave to you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_5" data-id="C11_5">He has made you rich in every way, in all speech and with all knowledge.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_6" data-id="C11_6">He has made you rich, just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed as true among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_7" data-id="C11_7">Therefore you lack no spiritual gift, as you eagerly wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_8" data-id="C11_8">He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_9" data-id="C11_9">God is faithful, he who called you into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_10" data-id="C11_10">Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree, and that there be no divisions among you. I urge that you be joined together with the same mind and by the same purpose.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_11" data-id="C11_11">For Chloe's people have reported to me that factions are developing among you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_12" data-id="C11_12">I mean this: Each one of you says, "I am with Paul," or "I am with Apollos," or "I am with Cephas," or "I am with Christ."</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_13" data-id="C11_13">Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_14" data-id="C11_14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_15" data-id="C11_15">This was so that no one would say that you were baptized into my name.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_16" data-id="C11_16">(I also baptized the household of Stephanas.  Beyond that, I do not know if I baptized any others.)</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_17" data-id="C11_17">For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel. He did not send me to preach with words of human wisdom, so that the cross of Christ should not be emptied of its power.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_18" data-id="C11_18">For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are dying. But among those whom God is saving, it is the power of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">For it is written,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise.</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v C11_19" data-id="C11_19">I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent." </span>
</div>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_20" data-id="C11_20">Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this world? Has not God turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_21" data-id="C11_21">Since the world in its wisdom did not know God, it pleased God through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_22" data-id="C11_22">For Jews ask for miraculous signs and Greeks seek wisdom.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_23" data-id="C11_23">But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Greeks. </span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_24" data-id="C11_24">But to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Christ as the power and the wisdom of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_25" data-id="C11_25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than people, and the weakness of God is stronger than people.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_26" data-id="C11_26">Look at God's call on you, brothers and sisters. Not many of you were wise by human standards. Not many of you were powerful. Not many of you were of noble birth.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_27" data-id="C11_27">But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise. God chose what is weak in the world to shame what is strong.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_28" data-id="C11_28">God chose what is low and despised in the world. He even chose things that are regarded as nothing, to bring to nothing things that are held as valuable. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_29" data-id="C11_29">He did this so that no one would have a reason to boast before him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_30" data-id="C11_30">Because of what God did, now you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God. He became our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v C11_31" data-id="C11_31">As a result, as scripture says, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."</span>

<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_1" data-id="TT3_1">Remind them to submit to rulers and authorities, to obey them, to be ready for every good work,</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_2" data-id="TT3_2">to revile no one, to avoid arguing, to let other people have their way, and to show humility to all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_3" data-id="TT3_3">For once we ourselves were thoughtless and disobedient. We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures. We lived in evil and envy. We were detestable and hated one another.</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_4" data-id="TT3_4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_5" data-id="TT3_5">he saved us through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, not because of works that we have done in righteousness but according to his mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_6" data-id="TT3_6">God richly poured the Holy Spirit on us through our Savior Jesus Christ</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_7" data-id="TT3_7">so that, having been justified by his grace, we became heirs of the confidence of eternal life.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_8" data-id="TT3_8">These words are trustworthy. I want you to speak confidently about these things, so that those who trust God may set their minds on the good works that he put before them. These things are good and profitable for all people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_9" data-id="TT3_9">But avoid foolish debates and genealogies and strife and conflict about the law. Those things are worthless and unprofitable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_10" data-id="TT3_10">Reject anyone who is causing divisions among you after one or two warnings,</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_11" data-id="TT3_11">and know that such a one has turned from the right way and is sinning and condemns himself.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_12" data-id="TT3_12">When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, hurry and come to me at Nicopolis where I have decided to spend the winter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_13" data-id="TT3_13">Hurry and send Zenas, the expert in law, and Apollos, with everything that they need.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v TT3_14" data-id="TT3_14">Our people must learn to engage themselves in good works that meet urgent needs so that they may not be unfruitful.</span>

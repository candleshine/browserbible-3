<span class="v-num v-1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_1" data-id="AC11_1">Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_2" data-id="AC11_2">When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, they who belonged to the circumcision group criticized him;</span>
<span class="v-num v-3">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_3" data-id="AC11_3">they said, "You associated with uncircumcised men and ate with them!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-4">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_4" data-id="AC11_4">But Peter started to explain the matter to them in detail; he said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-5">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_5" data-id="AC11_5">I was praying in the city of Joppa, and I had a vision of a container coming down, like a large sheet let down from heaven by its four corners. It descended to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_6" data-id="AC11_6">I gazed at it and I thought about it. I saw the four-legged animals of earth, wild beasts, creeping animals, and birds of the sky.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_7" data-id="AC11_7">Then I heard  a voice say to me, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-8">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_8" data-id="AC11_8">I said, "Not so, Lord: for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_9" data-id="AC11_9">But the voice answered again from heaven, "What God has declared clean, do not call unclean."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_10" data-id="AC11_10">This happened three times, and then everything was taken back up into heaven again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-11">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_11" data-id="AC11_11">Behold, right away there were three men standing in front of the house where we were; they had been sent from Caesarea to me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_12" data-id="AC11_12">The Spirit commanded me to go with them, and that I should make no distinction regarding them. These six brothers went with me, and we went into the man's house.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_13" data-id="AC11_13">He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, "Send men to Joppa and bring back Simon, whose other name is Peter.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_14" data-id="AC11_14">He will speak to you a message by which you will be saved—you and all your household."</span>
<span class="v-num v-15">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_15" data-id="AC11_15">As I began to speak to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, just as on us in the beginning.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_16" data-id="AC11_16">I remembered the words of the Lord, how he said, "John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."</span>
<span class="v-num v-17">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_17" data-id="AC11_17">Then if God gave to them the same  gift as he gave to us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could oppose God?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-18">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_18" data-id="AC11_18">When they heard these things, they said nothing in response, but they praised God and said, "Then God has given repentance for life to the Gentiles also."</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-19">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_19" data-id="AC11_19">Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem—these believers went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They told the message about Jesus only to Jews, and to no one else. </span>
<span class="v-num v-20">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_20" data-id="AC11_20">But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, came to Antioch and spoke to Greeks also and preached the Lord Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_21" data-id="AC11_21">And the hand of the Lord was with them; a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_22" data-id="AC11_22">News about them came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem: and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_23" data-id="AC11_23">When he came and saw the gift of God, he was glad; and he encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with all their heart.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_24" data-id="AC11_24">For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added to the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_25" data-id="AC11_25">Barnabas then went out to Tarsus to look for Saul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_26" data-id="AC11_26">When he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It came about, that for an entire year they gathered together with the church and taught many people. The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</span>

<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-27">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_27" data-id="AC11_27">Now in these days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_28" data-id="AC11_28">One of them, Agabus by name, stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine would occur over all the world. This happened in the days of Claudius. </span>
<span class="v-num v-29">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_29" data-id="AC11_29">So, the disciples, as each one was able, decided to send help to the brothers in Judea.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC11_30" data-id="AC11_30">They did this; they sent money to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span>
